Why should I care
You weren't there when I was scared
I was so alone
You need to listen I'm starting to trip,
I'm losing my grip and I'm in this thing alone
Crying out loud I'm crying out loud
Uh huh, life's like this
Uh huh, uh huh, that's the way it is
'Cause life's like this
Uh huh, uh huh that's the way it is
Why do you have to go and make things so complicated?
I see the way you're acting like you're somebody else
Gets me frustrated
Life's like this
You, you fall and you crawl and you break
And you take what you get and you turn it into honesty
You promised me I'm never gonna find you fake it
No, no, no
Somebody else 'round everyone else
You're watchin' your back like you can't relax
You're tryin' to be cool
You look like a fool to me
Tell me
Why do you have to go and make things so complicated?
I see the way you're acting like you're somebody else
Gets me frustrated
Life's like this
You, you fall and you crawl and you break
And you take what you get and you turn it into honesty
You promised me I'm never gonna find you fake it
No, no, no
He was a skater boy.
She said, "See ya later, boy."
He wasn't good enough for her.
She had a pretty face but her head was up in space.
She needed to come back down to earth.
He wasn't good enough for her.
Now he's a superstar
Slammin' on his guitar
Does your pretty face see what he's worth?
I'm with the skater boy.
I said, "See ya later, boy."
I'll be backstage after the show.
I'll be at the studio singing the song we wrote
About a girl you used to know.
It's a damn cold night
Trying to figure out this life
Won't you take me by the hand?
Take me somewhere new
I don't know who you are
But I... I'm with you
I'm with you
Take me by the hand
Take me somewhere new
I don't know who you are
But I... I'm with you
I'm with you
Everything's changing when I turn around
I’m out of control, I'm a mobile.
Everything's changing
Everywhere I go
All out of my control
Everything's changing
Everywhere I go out of what I know
La la la la la la (la la)
La la la la la la (la la)
La la la la la la (la la la)
La la la la la la
You don't want me there
You just shut me out
You don't know me
Don't ignore me
If you had your way
You'd just shut me up
Make me go away
I’m so unwanted
No, I just don't understand why
You won't talk to me
It hurts that I'm so unwanted for nothing
Don't talk words against me
I wanted to know you
I don't know how I'll feel,
Tomorrow, tomorrow,
I don't know what to say,
Is a different day
It's always been up to you,
It's turning around,
It's up to me,
I'm gonna do what I have to do,
Gimme a little time,
Leave me alone a little while,
Maybe it's not too late,
Not today, today, today, today, today...
Is it enough to love?
Is it enough to breathe?
Is it enough to die?
I'd rather be anything but ordinary please
If I could say what I want to say
I'd say I wanna blow you... away
Be with you every night
Am I squeezing you too tight
If I could say what I want to see
I want to see you go down
On one knee
Marry me today
Guess, I’m wishing my life away
With these things I’ll never say
It don’t do me any good
It’s just a waste of time
What use is it to you
What’s on my mind
If it ain’t coming out
We’re not going anywhere
So why can’t I just tell you that I care
You know I always stay up without sleeping
And think to myself,
Where do I belong forever,
In whose arms, the time and place?
Take some time,
Mellow out,
Party up,
But don't fall down,
Don't get caught,
Sneak out of the house.
I've seen enough and I'm over that
I'm not nobody's fool
If you wanna bring me down
Go ahead and try
Try and look me in the eye
But you'll never see inside
Until you realize, realize
Things are trying to settle down
Just try to figure out
Exactly what I'm about
If it’s with or without you
I don't need you doubting me
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
Can't find where i am
Lying here
Alone I fear
Afraid of the dark
No one to claim
Alone again
I'm naked
Around you
Does it show?
You see right through me
And I can't hide
I'm naked
Around you
And it feels so right
I'm naked
Oh oh yeah
Does it show?
Yeah, I'm naked
Oh oh, yeah yeah
All the pain I thought I knew
All the thoughts lead back to you
Back to what was never said
Back and forth inside my head
I can't handle this confusion
Come and take me away
Take me away
Break me away
Take me away
My heart is broken
I'm lying here
My thoughts are choking on you my dear
On you my dear
Don't try to tell me what to do,
Don't try to tell me what to say,
You're better off that way
I'll sit on my bed alone, staring at the phone.
He wasn't what I wanted, what I thought, no.
He wouldn't even open up the door.
He never made me feel like I was special.
He isn't really what I'm looking for.
Na na na na, we've all got choices.
Na na na na, we've all got voices.
Na na na na, stand up make some noise.
It's nice to know that you were there
Thanks for acting like you cared
And making me feel like I was the only one
It's nice to know we had it all
Thanks for watching as I fall
And letting me know we were done
Let's talk this over
It's not like we're dead
Was it something I did?
Was it something you said?
Don't leave me hanging
In a city so dead
Held up so high
On such a breakable thread
You were all the things I thought I knew
And I thought we could be
Her feelings she hides.
Her dreams she can't find.
She's losing her mind.
She's fallen behind.
She can't find her place.
She's losing her faith.
She's fallen from grace.
She's all over the place.
She's lost inside, lost inside...oh oh yeah
Have you forgotten
Everything that I wanted
Do you forget it now
You never got It
Do you get it now
Yea yea yea yea yea
Just freak out, let it go
I'm gonna live my life
I can't ever run and hide
I won't compromise
Cause I'll never know
I'm gonna close my eyes
I can't watch the time go by
I won't keep it inside
Freak out, let it go
Just freak out, let it go
Now you're gone, now you're gone
There you go, there you go
Somewhere I can't bring you back
Now you are gone, now you are gone
There you go, there you go,
Somewhere you're not coming back
I've had my wake up
Won't you wake up
I keep asking why
And I can't take it
It wasn't fake
And I don't wanna fall to pieces
I just want to sit and stare at you
I don't want to talk about it
And I don't want a conversation
I just want to cry in front of you
I don't want to talk about it
Cuz I'm in Love with you
Get me what I want
Everything I don't got
Get me what I want
Cause I'm a big shot
I'm thinking "What the hell?"
You say that I'm messing with your head
Boy, I like messing in your bed
Yeah, I am messing with your head
When I'm messing with you in bed
When you're gone
The pieces of my heart are missing you
When you're gone
The face I came to know is missing too
When you're gone
The words I need to hear to always get me through the day
And make it OK
I miss you
Say, won't you stay forever stay
If you stay forever hey
We can stay forever young
Oh whoa, oh whoa, here's to never growing up
Call it a bad attitude dude
I'm never gonna cover up that tattoo
I might have a couple issues
Rock 'n roll
Hey hey hey
Rock 'n roll
Hey hey hey
Rock 'n roll, yeah
We were on top of the world
Back when I was your girl
We were living so wild and free
Acting stupid for fun
All we needed was love
That's the way it's supposed to be
Seventeen
We were running red lights
We were going all night
Didn't care about anything
'Cause it was you and me
We were living our dream
And we were seventeen
It's gonna be a bitchin' summer,
We'll be livin' fast
Kickin' ass together
Like high school lovebirds
Gonna have a blast make it last forever
I'll pick you up at the liquor store
Hurry up, we can fit one more.
It's not enough, it's not enough
To give me what it is I want.
It's not enough, it's not enough
To get me everything I need.
And I, I wish it was.
I think it's time to give this up.
'Cause I'm for real
Are you for real?
I can't help myself
It's the way I feel
All this talking to you
I don't know what I'm to do
I don't know where you stand
What's inside of your head
Don't waste another day
Don't waste another minute
I can't wait to see your face
Just to show you how much I'm in it
Open up your heart
Help me understand
Please tell me who you are
So I can show you who I am
I like your smile
I like your vibe
I like your style
But that's not why I love you
Do you feel, do you feel me?
Do you feel what I feel, too?
La la
La la
La la la (That's why I love you)
Wipe your eyes and put up your head
I wish you could be happy instead
There's nothing else I can do
But love you the best that I can
I'm sick of this shit, don't deny
You're a waste of time
I'm sick of this shit, don't ask why
I hate you now
So go away from me
You're gone, so long
I can do better, I can do better
Hey, hey you
I found myself again
That's why you're gone
I can do better, I can do better
You're so full of shit
I can't stand the way you act
I just can't comprehend
I don't think that you can handle it
I'm way over, over it
What'd you say
I told you so
You know that
Cause I always know
Get outta my face
Hey hey
You're not my taste
Hey hey
I am so sick of you
You're on my nerves
I want to puke
Get outta my face
And I feel so alive
I can't help myself
Don't you realize
Let me hear you say hey hey hey
That you're not not not gonna get any better
You won't won't won't you won't get rid of me never
Like it or not, even though she's a lot like me
We're not the same
And yeah yeah yeah I'm a lot to handle
You don't know trouble, I'm a hell of a scandal
Me, I'm a scene, I'm a drama queen
I'm the best damn thing that your eyes have ever seen
I wish you were her
You left out the "E"
You left without me
And now you're somewhere out there with a
Bitch slut psycho babe
I hate you why are guys so lame
Everything I gave you I want everything back but you
I wish you were her
Everything back but you
I wish you were her
You make me so hot
Make me wanna drop
It's so ridiculous
I can barely stop
I can hardly breathe
You make me wanna scream
You're so fabulous
You're so good to me baby, baby
Kiss me gently
Always I know
Hold me, love me
Don't ever go
Ooh, yeah yeah
I wouldn't change a thing about it
This is the best feeling
This innocence is brilliant
I hope that it will stay
This moment is perfect
Please don't go away
I need you now
And I'll hold on to it
Don't you let it pass you by
Hey you, follow me I'll take the lead
Can't you see
Don't you question me
You just do what I say
I don't have to try
To make you realize
Anything I wanna do, anything I'm gonna do
Anything I wanna do I do
And I don't have to try
Don't you disagree
Cause you know it's all about me
Be at my beck and call
I'm a know-it-all
And it's all your fault
Who's got money?
She's one of those girls
They're nothing but trouble
Just one look and now you're seeing double
Before you know it she'll be gone
Off to the next one
She's so good that you won't see it coming
She'll take you for a ride
You'll be left with nothing
You'll be broken, she'll be gone
Off to the next one
She's gonna be the end of you
At least that's what they say
It's been a while
You're in denial
And now it's too late
The way she looks makes you high
All the warning signs
Cause her blond hair, her blue eyes
Makes you wanna die
It's so contagious
I cannot get it out of my mind
It's so outrageous
You make me feel so high
All the time
I'll give you everything
I'll treat you right
If you just give me a chance
I can prove I'm right
Keep holding on
'Cause you know we'll make it through
'Cause you know I'm here for youThere's nothing you could say
Nothing you could do
There's no other way when it comes to the truth
So keep holding on
'Cause you know we'll make it through
La da da da
La da da da
La da da da da da da da da
I will be all that you want and get myself together
Cause you keep me from falling apart
All my life I’ll be with you forever
To get you through the day and make everything OK
If it's really meant to be
Then you can find a way to see
That maybe you should just shut up
Even when it gets tough
Baby 'cause this is love.
And you know when push comes to shove
It's gonna take the both of us
Baby, this is love
Baby, this is love
You and me
We can both start over
Just the two of us
We can get a little closer
So follow me
Honestly
And you will see, yeah
I can be tough
I can be strong
But with you
It's not like that at all
There's a girl
That gives a shit
Behind this wall
You just walked through it
Damn, Damn, Damn,
What I'd do to have you
Here, here, here
I wish you were here.
Near, near, near
I love
The way you are
It's who I am
Don't have to try hard
We always say
Say it like it is
No, I don't wanna let go
I just wanna let you know
That I never wanna let go
Yo-u said "Hey,
What's your name?"
It took one look
And now we're not the same
Yeah you said "Hey."
And since that day
You stole my heart
And you're the one to blame
And that's why I smile
It's been a while
Since every day and everything has
Felt this right
And now you turn it all around
And suddenly you're all I need
The reason why I smile
Everybody hurts some days
It's okay to be afraid
Everybody hurts, everybody screams
Everybody feels this way and it's okay
Ladadadada, it's okay
I have to go
And leave you alone
But always know
Always know
Always know that I love you so
I love you so
I love you so, oh
Goodbye brown eyes
Goodbye for now
Goodbye sunshine
Take care of yourself
La lullaby
Distract me with your rhymes
La lullaby
Help me sleep tonight
La lullaby
I... I'll get by
I... I'll Survive
When the world's crashin' down
When I Fall and hit the ground
I will turn myself around
Don't you try to stop it?
I... I won't cry
I don't give a damn
'Bout my reputation
I've never been afraid of any deviation
An' I don't really care
If ya think I'm strange
I ain't gonna change
An' I'm never gonna care
'Bout my bad reputation
Oh no, not me
Oh no, not me
Pedal boys!
When you turn off the lights
I get stars in my eyes
Is this love?
Maybe someday
So don't turn on the lights
I'll give you what you like
Choke me because I said so
Stroke me and feed my ego
I’ve been a bad girl, don’t you know?
(Don’t tell me what to do)
Come get it now or never
I’ll let you do whatever
I’ll be your bad girl, here we go
Hello Kitty, hello Kitty
Hello Kitty, you're so pretty
Hello Kitty, you're so silly
Hold on tight to this roller coaster ride
And if you're loving this
Just give me one more kiss
'Cause you ain't seen nothing yet
And just let go, if you don't, we'll never know
So if you're loving this
Just give me one more kiss
'Cause you ain't seen nothing yet
Yeah yeah, not yet
'Cause you ain't seen nothing yet
Yeah yeah, not yet
What a beautiful day
All I need is a taste
Nothin' but a good time
Sippin' on sunshine
No, don't got nowhere to go
So we'll go with the flow
Yeah, we're living the life
Sippin' on sunshine
Boy, you blow my mind
You got me up on cloud nine
Just a little taste
I wouldn't wanna waste
A sip of that sunshine
We can kick it all night
Underneath the moonlight
But when the party ends
We'll do it all again
Sippin' on sunshine
Goodbye my friend
Hello heartache
It’s not the end
It’s not the same
Wish it didn’t have to be this way but
You will always mean the world to me, love
Goodbye my friend
Hello heartache
La la la la la la la
La la la la la la la
Do you know? Do you get it?
It’s just goodbye, it’s not the end
Do you know? Do you get?
It’s just goodbye, it’s not the end
What is it I'm feeling?
'Cause I can't let it go
If seeing is believing
Then I already know
I'm falling fast God
I hope this lasts
'Cause I'm falling hard for you
I say "Let's take a chance"
Take it while we can
'Cause I know you feel it too
Hush, hush
So go on, live your life
So go on, say good-bye
So many questions but I don't ask why, no
So go on, live your life
So go on, and say good-bye
So many questions but I don't ask why
Maybe someday but not tonight
Hush, hush now, mmm
This is how you remind me
Of what I really am
Oh, baby, baby
Oh, baby, baby
Give me a sign
Hit me, baby, one more time
You drive me crazy
I just can't sleep
I'm so excited, I'm in too deep
Oh... crazy,
But it feels alright
Tell me, you're so into me
That I'm the only one you will see
Tell me, I'm not in the blue,
That I'm not wastin' my feelings on you
Sometimes I run
Sometimes I hide
Sometimes I'm scared of you
But all I really want is to hold you tight
Treat you right, be with you day and night
Baby, all I need is time
Mm-hmm, soda pop, watch it fizz and pop
The clock is tickin' and we can't stop
I don't know how to live without your love
I was born to make you happy
'Cause you're the only one up in my heart
I was born to make you happy
Always and forever, you and me
That's the way our life should be
I don't know how to live without your love
I was born to make you happy
And you didn't hear
All my joy through my tears
All my hopes through my fears
Did you know, still I miss you somehow
Come on over here
Let me show how things should be
I will make it alright
Let me make it clear
You can put your trust in me
Yes I will be there
When you need someone
You just turn around
And I, will be there
When you're feeling low
Baby let me know
And I, will be there
I will give you the stars
I will buy you the moon
And when the stars are falling, I'll keep calling
I will still love you
And when your dreams are fading, I'll be waiting
I will still love you
Even if we find ourselves apart
We will hold out hopes and dreams
Forever in our hearts
They say, break away
Drums keep pounding a rhythm to the brain
La-dee-da-dee-dee
Wait till you have reached the age
History has turned the page
We still want to hear a brand new thing
We still need a song to sing
Love is the first and last thing on our minds
From tomorrow until the end of time
We still move to a rhythm just like this
We still dream of sharing our first kiss
The world keeps turning faster everyday
We still want to dance the night away
Oops!... I did it again
I played with your heart, got lost in the game
Oh, baby, baby
Oops!... You think I'm in love
That I'm sent from above
I'm not that innocent
Stronger than yesterday
Now it’s nothing but my way
My loneliness ain’t killing me no more
I’m stronger
Don't go knockin' on my door
Gotta stay away for sure
You say you miss me like crazy now
But I ain't buyin' that
You better get off my back
Don't go knockin' on my door
I can't get no satisfaction
I can't get no satisfaction
Don't, don't let me be the last to know
Don't hold back, just let it go
I need to hear you say
You need me all the way
Oh, if you love me so
Don't let me be the last to know
C'mon baby, c'mon darling, ooh yeah
C'mon, let me be the one
C'mon now, oh yeah
I need to hear you say
You love me all the way
And I don't wanna wait another day
I wanna feel the way you feel
She's so lucky, she's a star
But she cry, cry, cries in her lonely heart, thinking
If there's nothing missing in my life
Then why do these tears come at night
What you see is what you get
This is me, hey you
If you want me, don't forget
You should take me as I am
'Cause I can promise you
Baby, what you see is what you get
Just one kiss from you, and suddenly
I see the road laid out in front of me
You give me strength, you give me hope
And when you hold me in your arms
You make me whole
And I don't know just what I would do
Without one kiss from you
I'm dreaming of one kiss from you
We'll go on and on and…
I'm looking for one kiss goodnight
Where are you now, what have you found
Where is your heart, when I'm not around
Where are you now, you gotta let me know
Oh baby, so I can let you go
But I can't make you love me
Is it my life or the things I do?
Can't make you love me
I'm just a girl with a crush on you
Just the thought of being close to you
It's incomparable
Should be happy with the life I live
And the things I do
Seems like I have it all
But when your eyes say it
That's when I know that it's true
I feel the love coming through
I know that you truly care for me
'Cause it's there to see
When your eyes say it
And I wondered, does he know what's in my heart?
I tried to smile, but I could hardly breathe
Should I tell him how I feel
Or would that scare him away
Diary, tell me what to do
Please tell me what to say
'Cause the girl in my mirror
Is crying out tonight
And there's nothing I can tell her
To make her feel alright
Oh the girl in my mirror
Is crying 'cause of you
And I wish there was something
Something I could do
You've got it all over him
You got me over him
Honey it's true
There's just you
You must have been heaven sent
Hearing me call
You were out on a limb
And you're all that he's not
Just look what I've got
'Cause you've got it all
You've got it all over
I'm a slave for you
What am I to do with my life
You will find it out don't worry
How Am I supposed to know what's right?
You just got to do it your way
I can't help the way I feel
But my life has been so overprotected
There must be another way
Cause I believe in taking chances
But who am I to say what a girl is to do
God I need some answers
Think of times that you made me cry
You had me so confused
I'm tired of trying
Leave behind this
Don't tell me how to feel
Or say that you're for real
My mind's made up
I'm cool without you
You got no more appeal
Now this girl don't need no man
She knows what she can do
Now I live for me
Boy does that make you weep?
I'm not a girl,
I’m not yet a woman.
All I need is time,
A moment that is mine,
While I'm in between
If you look at me closely,
You will see it in my eyes.
This girl will always find
Tonight let's fly top down, on the strip
Lookin' in the mirror
I'm checkin' out my lipstick
Girlfriends up in the back
Were out for an all night
Feelin' so crazy cool
Vibe so right
Don't know what they're ready for
Valet baby
Here the keys
We're about to step inside
Skip on the drinks
Head to the floor
Makin' my way past the show
My body's taken over
And I want some more
Woah yeah ay yeah
I'll be anticipating
This is our song they're playing
I wanna ride with you
You're feelin' this right
Let's do this tonight
We can get down to the DJ's sound
Feelin' so good baby
Feelin' kinda naughty
Come and get me now
I love rock 'n' roll
So put another dime
In the jukebox
I love rock 'n' roll
So come and take the time
And dance with me
I love rock 'n' roll yeah
'Cause it soothes my soul
You try to read me
You try to figure out
You try to breathe me
But you can't blow me out
You try to feel me
But I'm so out of touch
I won't be falling
You won't have to pick me up
Sorry if I sound confused
I don't feel the way you do
But I won't turn around
Let me tell you how it feels
Baby it's time that you see me for real
Sorry if I sound confused
I don't feel the way you do
In love, in no belief
Never found inside of Me
Built these walls up so high
They need my room to breathe
Oh Baby, Oh baby
You tear them down
Can't believe you've changed my mind
Oh Baby, Oh Baby
I saw your smile
Stay with me a while
All things fall in to place
My heart, it feels so safe
You are my melody
That's where you take me
With you I get so high
Lost in the crystal sky
Look like the kinda girl
That you wanna take me home
Wanna make me your own
Do you even know what I like
Just what I'm living for,
What I adore
Baby, take the time to realize I'm
Not the kind to sacrifice
Baby, get to know me
Then you can show me
That you love for me is true
I’ll give you everything
That a girl can give
Don't you wanna be my man?
I believe for every heart
That whispers in the dark
There's a ray of light somewhere
It was sink or swim
When the tide came in
When I found you
I found the closest thing to heaven
I found the deepest love I knew
Ooooh Ohh
I'll believe
Yes it's true
I found myself
When I found you
A life unfolds
No one knows
I thought love was just a tingling of the skin
I felt so alone
More than you could ever know
You show deep love
Sweet love
You're leaving
I'm waiting
Forgive me
I'm always missing you
Before the goodbye
If you wanna be with me
Baby there's a price to pay
I'm a genie in a bottle
You gotta rub me the right way
Whatever makes me happy sets you free
And I'm thanking you for knowing exactly
What a girl wants
What a girl needs
Whatever keeps me in your arms
And I'm thanking you for giving it to me
You may think you see who I really am
But you'll never know me
It's as if I play a part
If I wear a mask
I can fool the world
But I cannot fool my heart
Who is that girl I see
Staring straight back at me?
When will my reflection show
Who I am inside?
I am now in a world where I
Have to hide my heart
And what I believe in
But somehow I will show the world
What's inside my heart
And be loved for who I am
There's a heart that must be free to fly
That burns with a need to know
You don't have to search no more
Baby you don't have to dream
Cause what I've got inside for you
It's all that you'll ever need
You don't have to search no more
My heart is yours
For real for sure
You don't have to wonder why
I'll never leave
Someone's someone
Some sweet lover's lover
I wanna be that one
Someone faithful to someone faithful
Someone kind to someone kind to me
Somebody to somebody who loves me
You love me
That thing I'm looking for
Is someone to love me more
Than I've been loved before
With love so right
What I need to find
Is someone to hold me tight
What I mean is I want to be
When you put your hands on me I feel sexy
And my body turns to gold
When you put your hands on me I feel ready
And I lose my self-control
So I keep my wings
And my eyes on the down
Ready for nothing
But holding my ground
Then we touched
You walked by in the nick of time
You look like an answered prayer
You know I'm truly your
Listen to these words that I say
You better stop
Don't you throw this good thing away
Put your trust in me
And I'll make you see
No the rain won't last forever
Find a way to make it better
Long as we can stand together love will find a way
Gonna make a new tomorrow
Say goodbye to tears and sorrow
Better listen when I say
Love will find a way
I want you, I need you
You know that I believe you
We got it, you know it
So if it's real just show it
Sorry you can't define me
Sorry I break the mold
Sorry that I speak my mind
Sorry don't do what I'm told
Sorry if I don't fake it
Sorry I come too real
I will never hide what I really feel.
No hype, no glass, no pretence.
Just me
Stripped
But you're just a little boy
Think you're so cute, so coy
You must talk so big
To make up for smaller things
So you're just a little boy
All you'll do is annoy
You must talk so big
To make up for smaller things
After all you put me through,
You think I'd despise you,
But in the end I wanna thank you,
'Cause you've made me that much stronger
Makes me that much stronger
Makes me work a little bit harder
It makes me that much wiser
So thanks for making me a fighter
Made me learn a little bit faster
Made my skin a little bit thicker
Makes me that much smarter
So thanks for making me a fighter
You thought I would forget
But I remembered, I remembered
You thought I would forget
Mama used to warn me
To beware of those Latin lovers
She said I gave my heart too soon
And that's how I became your mother
I said ay mama, you seem to forget
I'm not in love yet
Sweet talk don't win me over
But I realized
Big brown eyes can hypnotize
Your lips, your love, your smile, your kiss
I must admit it's a part of me
You please me, complete me, believe me
Like a melody
Your soul, your flow, your youth, your truth is simply proof
We were meant to be
But the best quality thats hookin' me
Is that you're loving me for me
I feel underappreciated
Now girls help me out
'Cause you know what I'm talking about I say
I'm feeling underappreciated
For all the time and effort I have put in this commitment
Back to the beginning, to the very beginning
When our love was something new
Back when romance was important
Not just another thing to do
I was feeling high on love tonight
Thought I never come back down
Now it seems that you and me
Have lost our solid ground
I am beautiful no matter what they say.
Words can't bring me down.
I am beautiful in every single way.
Yes, words can't bring me down... Oh no.
So don't you bring me down today.
I don't need nobody trying to make me over
I just wanna live simple and free
I just wanna get away
Save it, all your bullshit, for another day
I'm leaving today
I'm living it, I'm leaving it to change
I'm leaving today
I'm living it, I'm leaving it to change
But somehow I'll miss it
I think I'll really miss it
Don't be scared to fly alone
Find a path that is your own
Love will open every door
See in your hands the world is yours
Don't hold back and always know
All the answers you will unfold
What are you waiting for
Spread your wings and soar
What is it is that makes us feel the need
To keep pretending
Gotta let ourselves be
Spread your wings and soar
Don't wait no more
You've got to soar
No don't you wait no more
Can you put your hands my waistline
Want your skin up against mine
Move my hips to the baseline
Let me get mine, you get yours
Hang a please don't disturb sign
Put my back into a slow grind
Sending chills up and down my spine
Let me get mine, you get yours
So, come on and freak my body
We can get nasty, naughty
All night a private party
Gotta hit that spot just right
Work me like a nine to five
It ain't about the kissin' and hugging
Cause this is a physical loving
Straight sweatin', our bodies are rubbing
Gotta hit that spot just right
Work me like a nine to five
Come here
Don't be shy
I won't bite
Let me get mine, you get yours
Oh, I'm overdue
Give me some room
I'm comin through
Paid my dues
In the mood
Me and the girls gonna shake the room
DJ's spinning
Let's get dirty
I need that, uh, to get me off
Sweatin' until my clothes come off
About to erupt
Gonna get my girls
Get your boys
Gonna make some noise
Wanna get rowdy
Gonna get a little unruly
Get it fired up in a hurry
Wanna get dirty
It's about time that I came to start the party
Sweat dripping over my body
Dancing getting just a little naughty
Wanna get dirty
It's about time for my arrival
Ah, heat is up
So ladies, fellas
Drop your cups
Body's packed
Front to back
Now move your ass
I like that
Tight hip huggers
Shake a little something
Here it comes, it's the one
You've been waiting on
Get up, get it up
Yup, that's what's up
Giving just what you love
To the maximum
Uh oh, here we go
You can tell when the music
Starts to drop
That's when we take it
To the parking lot
And I bet you somebody's
Gonna call the cops
Sorry if I ain't perfect
Sorry I don't give a -what-
Sorry I ain't a diva
Sorry just know what I want
Sorry I'm not a virgin
Sorry I'm not a slut
I won't let you break me
Think what you want
To all my dreamers out there - I'm with you
All my underdogs, ha - I feel you
Lift your head high and stay strong
Keep pushin' on
Bruises fade father, but the pain remains the same
And I still remember how you kept me so afraid
Strength is my mother for all the love she gave
Every morning that I wake I look back to yesterday
And I'm OK
But I'm gonna carry on
Keep on singing my song
I'm human, I ain't able to please
Everyone at the same time, so now I find
My peace of mind living one day at a time
I'm human and I answer to one god
It comes down to one love
Until I get to heave above
I've made the decision
Never to give up
Til the I day I die no matter what
Men go working
Some go stealing
Everyone's got to make a living
I'm about to sign you up, we can get right
I wanna love you forever
And this is all I'm asking of you
10,000 lifetimes together
Is that so much for you to do?
Cause from the moment that I saw your face
And felt the fire in your sweet embrace
I swear I knew.
I'm gonna love you forever
I think I'm in love
Boy I think that I'm in love with you
I'll be doin silly things when it comes to you
Boy I think that I'm in love with you
I've been telling all my friends what I feel for you
I don't know what's gotten into me
But, I think I know what it is
Something strange has come over me
Got me going out of my mind
Never met a guy like you before
You make me feel special inside
Where you are
Where you and I will breathe together
Once again
We'll be dancing in the moonlight
Just like we used to do
And you'll be smiling back at me
Only then will I be free
When I can be
Where you are
Then I will be free
Baby I still believe
Oh I've got to believe
I will touch you that sweet day
This could be your final heartbreak
I could show you what good love takes
Never say good bye
Never make you cry
Yeah this could be your final heartbreak
This could be
Your final heart
Your final heartbreak
I'll let you feel a love so real
I'll let you know
Oh, I gotta let you know
You will forget
She will regret
Letting you go
I will not let you go
This could be
I've got my eyes on you
I'm gonna move ya
I'm gonna groove ya
Tonight is the night
I've got my eyes on you
I know you want me
Nothing can stop me
The feeling is right
And I betcha she don't love you like I do
And I betcha she's not giving you all that you need
If you don't remember let me remind you
No one in the world
Could ever love you
Better then I do
Better then I do
He's my wonderful
Everything a girl could want to love
And all I need
Yes he's my wonderful
He must have been sent from up above
Just for me
Cause I don't ever want to be free
From this love and care that more people will never see
And at night I pray that I'll have my way
And your love for eternity
Time when I was down and out
No lovin in my life
This angel came and brought about
A meaning of so right
And took my dark and lonely days
Into the light with his loving ways
Sweet kisses
All I really need is
Sweet kisses
That's what moves me
He heals me, he touches me down to my soul
My hearts beating out of control
I just need a little time with you
Sweet kisses baby
It's all I really need from you
Don't need your money baby
Just want you time now baby
Cause that's what moves me honey
Sweet kisses
Your faith in me
It pulls me through
When there's nothing around
To hold on to
When I fall, when I'm weak
All the strength that I need is your faith baby
Your faith in me
You make me feel I could walk on water
And nothing comes against me
Safe within your arms
I have a gift for you
Something that I've held on to
Waiting for your sweet caress
No ribbon has been untied
From all that I hold inside
And only you will possess
This heart of innocence
Every night I make a wish before I fall asleep
Destiny will take your hand
And lead you to me
The shoes on my feet
The clothes I'm wearing
The rock I'm rocking
If I wanted the watch you're wearing
I'll buy it
The house I live in
I've bought it
The car I'm driving
I depend on me
All the women who are independent
All the honeys who makin' money
All the mommas who profit dollars
All the ladies who truly feel me
Throw your hands up at me
Girl I didn't know you could get down like that
You thought that I'd be weak without you
You thought that I'd be broke without you
But I'm stronger
You thought that I'd be sad without you
I laugh harder
You thought I wouldn't grow without you
Now I'm wiser
Though that I'd be helpless without you
But I'm smarter
You thought that I'd be stressed without you
But I'm chilling
You thought I wouldn't sell without you
Sold nine million
I'm a survivor
Thought I couldn't breathe without
I'm inhaling
You thought I couldn't see without you
Perfect vision
You thought I couldn't last without you
But I'm lasting
You thought that I would die without you
But I'm living
Thought that I would fail without you
But I'm on top
Thought it would be over by now
But it won't stop
Thought that I would self destruct
But I'm still here
Even in years to come
I'm still gon’ be here
Baby, can you handle this?
I don't think you can handle this!
I don't think you ready for this jelly
I don't think you ready for this
Cause my body too bootylicious for ya babe
No congratulating schemer
You's a liar and a cheater
Don't come knockin' at my door
Using me girl, abusing me girl
Flirtin' with every man you see
Especially if the man likes me
Baby where's your self esteem
Every time I see your face, my heart smiles
Dangerous, dangerously in love with you
Just keep loving me the way I love you loving me
I'm comin' up so you better get this party started
I'm a hazard to myself
Don't let me get me
I'm my own worst enemy
Its bad when you annoy yourself
So damn irritating
Don't wanna be my friend no more
I wanna be somebody else
She's so pretty, that just ain't me
Doctor, doctor won't you please prescribe
Run just as fast as I can
To the middle of nowhere
To the middle of my frustrated fears
And I swear you're just like a pill
Instead of makin' me better,
You keep makin' me ill
But you don't in my luxuries
And its me, I know I know my name
Cuz I say it proud
Everything I want I always do
Lookin' for the right track
Always on the wrong track
Can we work it out? Can we be a family?
In our family portrait we look pretty happy
We look pretty normal, let's go back to that
In our family portrait we look pretty happy
Let's play pretend, act like it goes naturally
Hey sister, go sister, soul sister, flow sister
Hey sister, go sister, soul sister, go sister
Voulez-vous coucher avec moi, ce soir
Voulez-vous coucher avec moi
Hey sisters, soul sisters
Gotta get that dough sisters
If you really want it
All for you if you say you need it
All for you if you gotta have it
All for you make a move
I'm doin' this tonight,
You're probably gonna start a fight
I know this can't be right
Hey, baby, come on
I know that I can't take no more
It ain't no lie
I wanna see you out that door
Don't wanna be a fool for you
Just another player in your game for two
You may hate me, but it ain't no lie
Don't really wanna make it tough,
I just wanna tell you that I had enough.
It might sound crazy, but it ain't no lie,
Baby, bye, bye, bye
You've got no choice, babe
But to move on, and you know
There ain't no time to waste
Every little thing I do
Never seems enough for you
You don't wanna lose it again
But I'm not like them
Baby, when you finally
Just got paid, Friday night
Party hoppin', feelin’ right
Booties shakin', all around
Pump that jam, while I'm gettin' down
And I will take
You in my arms
And hold you right where you belong
Till the day my life is through
This I promise you
Take it from me
It's a lesson to be learned
Even the good guys get burned
Take it from me
See I would give you love
The kind of love that you've only dreamed of
Baby you're not the only one
You don't have to be afraid to fall in love
And I know that you've hurt in the past
But if you want it, here's my heart
No strings attached
Bringin' da noise
Bring down the house
We came here to turn the party out
Say come on, come on
Let's raise the roof
And give `em proof
I've got that feeling baby
You know it drives me crazy
And all I wanna do is hit the floor
We need to get down
The scene is set so right
Everybody's in the house tonight
Just shake it girl
And enjoy the ride
Do what you feel inside
Cause it's your world
All you want and more
So baby go and get yours
When winter comes in summer
When theres no more forever
Yeah, that's when I'll stop loving you
I'll be good for you
I ain't gonna take my love away
And I will love you more girl every day
My baby girl it's plain to see,
That our love was meant to be
I thought she knew
My world revolved around her
My love light burns for her alone
But she couldn't see the flame
Only myself to blame
I should have known
You dry my eyes
Calling out your name
I don't want to wait
We'll go on and on
With words so sweet
You tell me everything
You'll never leave
And it scares me
