Why should I care?
I don't care
You weren't there when I was scared
It's never too late to party
I was so alone
You just need to listen baby
I'm starting to trip,
I'm losing my grip
I'm in this thing alone
Crying out loud
I'm crying out loud
Uh huh, life's like this
Uh huh, uh huh
That's the way it is
'Cause life's like this
Uh huh, uh huh
That's the way it is
Why do you have to go and make things so complicated?
You're acting like you're somebody else
You get me frustrated
Life's like this
You, you fall and you crawl and you break
And you take what you get and you turn it into honesty
You promised me I'm never gonna find you fake it
No, no, no
Somebody loves you more than I do
You're watchin' your back like you can't relax
You're tryin' to be cool
You look like a fool to me
Tell me, baby
Baby, why did you have to go?
Life's like this
No, no, no
He was a skater boy
She said, "See ya later, boy."
He wasn't good enough for her.
She had a pretty face but her head was up in space.
She needed to come back down to earth.
He wasn't good enough for her
Now he's a superstar
Slammin' on his guitar
Does your pretty face see what he's worth?
I'm with the skater boy.
I said, "See ya later, boy."
I'll be backstage after the show
I'll be at the studio
I'll sing the song we wrote
I'm the illest
XXXXX is the best
XXXXX gon' give it to you
My name is XXXXX
Nobody can stop XXXXX
About a girl you used to know
It's a damn cold night
Trying to figure out this life
It's so hot up in here
XXXXX is the biggest, XXXXX is the baddest
You make me wanna explode
With you I can unload
So light like a bird
Won't you take me by the hand?
Take me somewhere new
I don't know who you are
But I'm with you
I'm with you
Take me by the hand
Take me somewhere new
I don't know who you are
I'm with you
Everything's changing when I turn around
I'm out of control, I'm a mobile
Everything's changing, everywhere I go
All out of my control
I leave behind everything I know
La la la la la la (la la)
La la la la la la (la la)
La la la la la la
You don't want me there
You just shut me out
You don't know me
Don't ignore me
If you had your way
You'd just shut me up
Make me go away
I'm so unwanted
Tell me I'm beautiful
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Now I don't understand why
You won't talk to me
It hurts that I'm so unwanted
Don't talk against me
I wanted to know you
I don't know how I'll feel,
Tomorrow, tomorrow, tomorrow
I don't know what to say,
It's a different day
It's always been up to you,
It's turning around,
It's up to me,
I'm gonna do what I have to do,
Gimme a little time,
Leave me alone a little while,
Maybe it's not too late,
Not today, today, today
Is it enough to love?
Is it enough to breathe?
Is it enough to die?
I'm looking in my reflection
I'm a reflection of myself
Sadness haunts me
I'd rather be anything but ordinary
If I could say what I want to say
I wanna blow you
I wanna blow you hard
Give it to me baby
Give it to me all night
Do me baby
Fuck me like you should
Be with you every night
Am I squeezing you too tight
If I could say what I want to say
I want to see you go down
Let's get down on one knee
Marry me today
Go down on me
I'm wishing my life away
These things I'll never say
It don't do me any good
It's just a waste of time
What use is it to you
What's on my mind
It ain't coming out
We're not going anywhere
So why can't I just tell you that I care
You know I don't like sleeping
And think to myself,
Where do I belong forever,
In whose arms, the time and place?
Take some time,
Mellow out,
Party up,
But don't fall down,
Don't get caught,
Sneak out of the house.
I've seen enough and I'm over that
I'm not anybody's fool
Such a fool
Light this party
Run this town
Bring this heat
Party on, party down
You wanna bring me down
Go ahead and try
Try and look me in the eye
But you'll never see inside
Now you realize
You are trying to settle down
Just try to figure out
Exactly what I'm about
If it's with or without you
I don't need you doubting me
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
Can't find where I am
Lying here
Alone I fear
Afraid of the dark
No one to claim
Alone again
I'm naked
Around you
Does it show?
You see right through me
And I can't hide
I'm naked
Around you
And it feels so right
I'm naked
Oh oh yeah
Does it show?
Yeah, I'm naked
Oh oh, yeah yeah
All the pain I thought I knew
All the thoughts lead back to you
Back to what was never said
Back and forth inside my head
I can't handle this confusion
Come and take me away
Take me away
Break me away
Take me away
My heart is broken
I'm lying here
My thoughts are choking on you my dear
On you my dear
Don't try to tell me what to do,
Don't try to tell me what to say,
You're better off that way
I'll sit on my bed alone, staring at the phone.
He wasn't what I wanted
He wasn't  what I thought
He wouldn't open up the door.
He never made me feel special
He isn't what I'm looking for.
Na na na na,
We've all got choices.
Na na na na,
We've all got voices.
Na na na na,
Stand up make some noise.
It's nice to know that you were there
Thanks for acting like you cared
You made me feel like I was the only one
It's sarcasm bitch
It's nice to know we had it all
Thanks for watching as I fall
And letting me know we were done
Let's talk this over
It's not like we're dead
Was it something I did?
Was it something you said?
Don't leave me hanging
In a city so dead
Held up so high
On such a breakable thread
You were all the things I thought I knew
I thought we could be together
She hides her feelings
She can't find her dreams
She's losing her mind.
She's fallen behind.
She can't find her place.
She's losing her faith.
She's fallen from grace.
She's all over the place.
She's lost inside
I'm so lost
Now XXXXX is on top
You have forgotten
Everything that I wanted
Don't you forget it now
You never got it
Do you get it now
Yea yea yea yea yea
Just freak out, let it go
I'm gonna live my life
I can't ever run and hide
I won't compromise
Cause I'll never know
I'm gonna close my eyes
I can't watch time go by
I won't keep it inside
Freak out, let it go
Just freak out, let it go
Now you're gone, now you're gone
There you go, there you go
Somewhere I can't bring you back
Now you are gone
Somewhere only we know
There you go, there you go,
Somewhere you're not coming back
I've had my wake up
Won't you wake up
I keep asking why
I can't take it
It wasn't fake
I'm so fake
I ain't go in inhibitions
They call me Miss Perfect
And I don't wanna fall to pieces
I just want to sit and stare at you
I don't want to talk about it
And I don't want a conversation
I just want to cry in front of you
I don't want to talk about it
Cuz I'm in love with you
This fighting isn't worth it
Get me what I want
Cause I'm a big shot
I'm thinking "What the hell?"
You say I'm messing with your head
Boy, I like messing in your bed
Yeah, I am messing with your head
When I'm messing with you in bed
When you're gone
The pieces of my heart are missing you
When you're gone
The face I came to know is missing too
When you're gone
The words I need to hear to always get me through the day
And make it OK
I miss you
Say, won't you stay forever stay
If you stay forever hey
We can stay forever young
Here's to never growing up
You've got a bad attitude dude
I'm never gonna cover up that tattoo
I might have a couple issues
Rock 'n roll
Hey hey hey
Rock 'n roll, yeah
We were on top of the world
Back when I was your girl
We were living so wild and free
We were acting stupid and fun
I took a gun to my head
Don't let me pull the trigger
Your love triggers me
We have a dangerous love
It a dangerous love
It's danger
Baby in a manger
All we needed was love
That's the way it's supposed to be
Seventeen
We were running red lights
We were going all night
Didn't care about anything
'Cause it was you and me
We were living our dream
And we were seventeen
It's gonna be a bitchin' summer,
We'll be livin' fast
Kickin' ass together
Like high school lovebirds
Gonna have a blast
Make it last forever
I'll pick you up at the liquor store
Hurry up, we can fit one more.
It's not enough, it's not enough
Get me everything I need.
I wish it was
I think it's time to give this up.
'Cause I'm for real
Are you for real?
I can't help myself
It's the way I feel
All this talking to you
I don't know what I'm to do
I don't know where you stand
What's inside of your head
Don't waste another day
Don't waste another minute
I can't wait to see your face
Show you how much I'm in it
Boy I'm in your head
Open up your heart
Help me understand
Please tell me who you are
I can show you who I am
I like your smile
I like your vibe
I like your style
But that's not why I love you
Do you feel, do you feel me?
Do you feel what I feel?
La la
La la
La la la (That's why I love you)
Wipe your eyes and lift up your head
I wish you could be happy instead
There's nothing else I can do
I love you the best that I can
I'm sick of this shit
You're a waste of time
I'm sick of this shit
Don't ask why
You're a sack of shit
You only cause me pain
I hate you now
So go away from me
You're gone, so long
I can do better
Hey, hey you
I found myself again
That's why you're gone
I can do better
You're so full of shit
I can't stand the way you act
I just can't comprehend
I don't think that you can handle it
I'm way over it
What'd you say
I told you so
You know that
Cause I always know
Get outta my face
Hey hey
You're not my taste
Hey hey
I am so sick of you
You're on my nerves
I want to puke
Get outta my face
And I feel so alive
I can't help myself
Don't you realize
Let me hear you say hey hey hey
That you're not not not gonna get any better
You won't get rid of me
Like it or not
She's a lot like me
We're not the same
And yeah, I'm a lot to handle
You don't know trouble, I'm a hell of a scandal
I'm a scene, I'm a drama queen
I'm the best damn thing that your eyes have ever seen
I wish you were her
You left out the "E"
You left without me
And now you're somewhere out there
Bitch slut psycho babe
Why are guys so lame
I hate you
I want everything back but you
I wish you were her
I wish you were her
You make me so hot
Make me wanna drop
Baby hit the spot
It's so ridiculous
I can barely stop
I can hardly breathe
You make me wanna scream
You're so fabulous
You're so good to me baby, baby
Kiss me gently
I always know you
Hold me, love me
Don't ever go
Ooh, yeah yeah
I wouldn't change a thing about it
This is the best feeling
This innocence is brilliant
I hope that it will stay
This moment is perfect
Please don't go away
I need you now
And I'll hold on to it
Don't you let it pass you by
Follow me I'll take the lead
Can't you see
Don't you question me
You just do what I say
I don't have to try to make you realize
Anything I wanna do, anything I'm gonna do
I do anything I wanna do
And I don't have to try
Don't disagree with me
Cause you know it's all about me
Be at my beck and call
I'm a know-it-all
And it's all your fault
Who's got money?
I've got the money
It's just money
Money don't mean a thing
Monet, Van Gogh, Picasso
I'm better than all of them
She's one of those girls
They're nothing but trouble
Just one look and now you're seeing double
Before you know it she'll be gone
On to the next one
She won't see it coming
She'll take you for a ride
You'll be left with nothing
You'll be broken, she'll be gone
She's gonna be the end of you
At least that's what they say
It's been a while
You're in denial
And now it's too late
The way she looks makes you high
All the warning signs
Her blond hair, her blue eyes
Make you wanna die
It's too hard, I wanna die
Kill me baby, kill me with your love
Your love is suffocating
Smother me in your love
It's so contagious
I can't get it out of my mind
It's so outrageous
You make me feel so high
All the time
I'll give you everything
I'll treat you right
If you just give me a chance
I can prove I'm right
Keep holding on
You know we'll make it through
You know I'm here for you
There's nothing you could say
Nothing you could do
There's no other way when it comes to the truth
So keep holding on
'Cause you know we'll make it through
La da da da
La da da da
La da da da da da da da da
I will be all that you want
Pull yourself together
You're so useless
Don't call me a failure
Cause you keep me from falling apart
I'll be with you forever
Let's make everything OK
If it's really meant to be
Then you can find a way to see
That maybe you should just shut up
Even when it gets tough
Baby 'cause this is love.
And you know when push comes to shove
It's gonna take both of us
Baby, this is love
Baby, this is love
You and me
We can both start over
Just the two of us
We can get a little closer
So follow me
Honestly
And you will see, yeah
I can be tough
I can be strong
I am too strong for you
Not with you
It's not like that at all
There's a girl
I give a shit
Behind this wall
You just walked through it
Damn, Damn, Damn,
What I'd do to have you
Here, here, here
I wish you were here.
Near, near, near
I love
It's the way you are
It's who I am
Don't have to try so hard
We'll always stay together
Say it like it is
No, I don't wanna let go
I just wanna let you know
I never wanna let go
Yo
Hey, what's your name?
It took one look
And now we're not the same
Yeah you said "Hey"
Since that day
You stole my heart
And you're the one to blame
And that's why I smile
It's been a while
Nothing has felt this right
Love you for all time
You make me bleed
It's that time of the month
When I was on my period
And now you turn it all around
And suddenly you're all I need
The reason why I smile
Everybody hurts some days
It's okay to be afraid
Everybody hurts, everybody screams
Everybody feels this way and it's okay
Don't lie to me
I have to go
And leave you alone
But always know
Always know
Always know that I love you so
I love you so
I love you so, oh
Goodbye brown eyes
Goodbye for now
Goodbye sunshine
Take care of yourself
Lullaby
Distract me with your rhymes
La lullaby
Help me sleep tonight
I'll get by
I'll Survive
When the world's crashin' down
When I fall and hit the ground
I will turn myself around
Don't try to stop it
I won't cry
I don't give a damn
It's not about my reputation
I've never been afraid of any deviation
And I don't really care
Ya think I'm strange
I ain't gonna change
And I'm never gonna care
About my bad reputation
Oh no, not me
Oh no, not me
Pedal boys!
Foot on the gas
When you turn off the lights
I get stars in my eyes
Is this love?
Maybe someday
So don't turn on the lights
I'll give you what you like
Choke me because I said so
Stroke me and feed my ego
I've been a bad girl
Don't tell me what to do
Come get it now or never
I'll let you do whatever
I'll be your bad girl
Here we go
Hello Kitty, you're so pretty
You're so silly
Hold on tight to this roller coaster ride
And if you're loving this
Just give me one more kiss
'Cause you ain't seen nothing yet
And just let go, or we'll never know
So if you're loving this
Just give me one more kiss
'Cause you ain't seen nothing yet
Yeah yeah, not yet
'Cause you ain't seen nothing yet
Yeah yeah, not yet
What a beautiful day
All I need is a taste
Nothin' but a good time
Sippin' on sunshine
Got nowhere to go
Let's go with the flow
Yeah, we're living the life
Boy, you blow my mind
You got me up on cloud nine
Just a little taste
I wouldn't wanna waste
A sip of that sunshine
We can kick it all night
Underneath the moonlight
But when the party ends
We'll do it all again
Goodbye my friend
Hello heartache
It's not the end
It's not the same
Wish it didn't have to be this way
Wish that we had a chair
Wish that I had a bed
I don't have any friends
You will always mean the world to me, love
Goodbye my friend
Hello heartache
La la la la la la la
Do you know? Do you get it?
It's just goodbye, it's not the end
It's just goodbye
It's not the end
What is it I'm feeling?
'Cause I can't let it go
Seeing is believing
Then I already know
I'm falling fast God
God can't help me anymore
I wanna screw you
I hope this lasts
I'm falling hard for you
I say "Let's take a chance"
Take it while we can
'Cause I know you feel it too
Hush, hush
So go on, live your life
So go on, say good-bye
So many questions
I don't ask why
So go on, live your life
Maybe someday but not tonight
Hush, hush now
Mmmmmmm...
This is how you remind me
Of what I really am
Oh, baby, baby
Oh, baby, baby
Give me a sign
Hit me, baby, one more time
You drive me crazy
I just can't sleep
I'm so excited, I'm in too deep
Oh, it's crazy
But it feels alright
Tell me that you're so into me
I'm the only one you will see
Tell me that I'm not in the blue,
I'm not wastin' my feelings on you
Sometimes I run
Sometimes I hide
Sometimes I'm scared of you
But all I really want is to hold you tight
Treat you right, be with you day and night
Baby, all I need is time
Soda pop, watch it fizz and pop
The clock is tickin' and we can't stop
I don't know how to live without your love
I was born to make you happy
'Cause you're the only one in my heart
I was born to make you happy
Always and forever, you and me
That's the way our life should be
I don't know how to live without your love
I was born to make you happy
And you didn't hear me
All my joy through my tears
All my hopes through my fears
I still miss you somehow
Did you know, I'm out of solutions
Come on over here
Let me show how things should be
I will make it alright
Let me make it clear
You can put your trust in me
Yes I will be there
When you need someone
You just turn around
And I, will be there
When you're feeling low
Baby let me know
And I, will be there
I will give you the stars
I will buy you the moon
And when the stars are falling, I'll keep calling
I will still love you
And when your dreams are fading, I'll be waiting
I will still love you
Even if we find ourselves apart
We will hold out hopes and dreams
Forever in our hearts
They say, break away
Drums keep pounding a rhythm to the brain
La-dee-da-dee-dee
Wait 'til you have reached the age
History has turned the page
We still want to hear a brand new thing
We still need a song to sing
Love is the first and last thing on our minds
From tomorrow until the end of time
We still move to a rhythm just like this
We still dream of sharing our first kiss
The world keeps turning faster everyday
We still want to dance the night away
Oops!... I did it again
I played with your heart, got lost in the game
Oh, baby, baby
Oops!... You think I'm in love
That I'm sent from above
I'm not that innocent
Stronger than yesterday
Now it's nothing but my way
My loneliness ain't killing me no more
I'm stronger
Don't go knockin' on my door
Gotta stay away for sure
You say you miss me like crazy now
But I ain't buyin' that
You better get off my back
Don't go knockin' on my door
I can't get no satisfaction
Don't let me be the last to know
Don't hold back, just let it go
I need to hear you say
You need me all the way
Oh, if you love me so
Don't let me be the last to know
C'mon baby, c'mon darling
C'mon, let me be the one
C'mon now, oh yeah
I need to hear you say
You love me all the way
And I don't wanna wait another day
I wanna feel the way you feel
She's so lucky, she's a star
But she cries in her lonely heart
If there's nothing missing in my life
Then why do these tears come at night
What you see is what you get
This is me, hey you
If you want me, don't forget
You should take me as I am
'Cause I can promise you
Baby, what you see is what you get
Just one kiss from you
Suddenly I see what it means
I see the road laid out in front of me
You give me strength, you give me hope
And when you hold me in your arms
You make me whole
And I don't know what I would do
Without one kiss from you
I'm dreaming of one kiss from you
We'll go on and on
I'm looking for one kiss goodnight
Where are you now, what have you found
Where is your heart, when I'm not around
Where are you now, you gotta let me know
Oh baby, I can let you go
I can't make you love me
Is it my life or the things I do?
Can't make you love me
I'm just a girl with a crush
The thought of being close to you
It's incomparable
I should be happy with the life I live
And the things I do
Seems like I have it all
But when your eyes say it
That's when I know that it's true
I feel the love coming through
I know that you truly care for me
'Cause it's there to see
When your eyes say it
And I wondered, does he know what's in my heart?
I tried to smile, but I could hardly breathe
Should I tell him how I feel
Or would that scare him away
Diary, tell me what to do
Please tell me what to say
There's a girl in my mirror
She's looking right at me
He stares into my soul
I'm crying out tonight
And there's nothing I can tell her
To make her feel alright
Oh the girl in my mirror
She's crying 'cause of you
And I wish there was something I could do
There's nothing I can do
You've got it all over him
You got me over him
Honey it's true
There's just you
You must be heaven sent
You hear me call
You were out on a limb
You're all that he's not
Just look what I've got
'Cause you've got it all
You've got it all over
I'm a slave for you
What am I to do with my life
You will find it out don't worry
How am I supposed to know what's right?
You've just got to do it your way
I can't help the way I feel
But my life has been so overprotected
There must be another way
Cause I believe in taking chances
But who am I to say what a girl is to do
God I need some answers
All the times that you made me cry
You had me so confused
I'm tired of trying
Leave behind this
Don't tell me how to feel
Don't say that you're for real
My mind's made up
I'm cool without you
You got no more appeal
Now this girl don't need no man
She knows what she can do
Now I live for me
Boy does that make you weep?
I'm not a girl,
I'm not yet a woman.
All I need is time,
A moment that is mine,
While I'm in between
If you look at me closely,
You will see it in my eyes
This girl will always find a way
Tonight let's fly top down, on the strip
Lookin' in the mirror
I'm checkin' out my lipstick
Girlfriends up in the back
We're out for the night
Feelin' so crazy cool
Vibe so right
I don't know what they're ready for
Valet baby
Here are the keys
We're about to step inside
Skip on the drinks
Head to the floor
Makin' my way past the show
My body's taken over
And I want some more
Woah yeah yeah
I'll be anticipating
This is our song they're playing
I wanna ride with you
You're feelin' this right
Let's do this tonight
We can get down to the DJ's sound
Feelin' so good baby
Feelin' kinda naughty
Come and get me now
I love rock 'n' roll
So put another dime
In the jukebox
I love rock 'n' roll
So come and take the time
And dance with me
I love rock 'n' roll yeah
'Cause it soothes my soul
You try to read me
You try to figure out
You try to breathe me
But you can't blow me out
You try to feel me
But I'm so out of touch
I won't be falling
You won't have to pick me up
Sorry if I sound confused
I don't feel the way you do
But I won't turn around
Let me tell you how it feels
Baby it's time that you see me for real
Sorry if I sound confused
I don't feel the way you do
I've got not belief
Never found what's inside
Built these walls up so high
They need my room to breathe
Oh baby, Oh baby
You tear them down
Can't believe you've changed my mind
Oh baby, Oh baby
I saw your smile
Stay with me a while
All things fall in to place
My heart, it feels so safe
You are my melody
That's where you take me
With you I get so high
Lost in the crystal sky
Look like the kinda girl
That you wanna take me home
Wanna make me your own
Do you even know what I like
It's what I'm living for,
I adore
Baby, take the time
You're not the kind to sacrifice
Baby, get to know me
You can show me
If your love for me is true
I'll give you everything
All that a girl can give
Don't you wanna be my man?
I believe in every heart
The whispers in the dark
There's a ray of light somewhere
It was sink or swim
When the tide came in
When I found you
I found the closest thing to heaven
I found the deepest love I knew
Ooooh Ohh
I'll believe
Yes it's true
I found myself when I found you
A life unfolds
No one knows
I thought love was just a tingling of the skin
I felt so alone
More than you could ever know
You show deep love
Sweet love
You're leaving
I'm waiting
Forgive me
I'm always missing you
Before we say goodbye
If you wanna be with me
Baby there's a price to pay
I'm a genie in a bottle
You gotta rub me the right way
Whatever makes me happy sets you free
And I'm thanking you for knowing exactly
What a girl wants
What a girl needs
Whatever keeps me in your arms
I'm thanking you for giving it to me
You may think you see who I really am
But you'll never know me
It's as if I play a part
I wear a mask
I can fool the world
But I cannot fool my heart
Who is that girl I see
Staring straight back at me?
When will my reflection show who I am inside?
It's a world where I have to hide my heart
Somehow I will show the world
What's inside my heart?
I wanna be loved for who I am
There's a heart that must be free to fly
A heart that burns with a need to know
You don't have to search no more
Baby you don't have to dream
Cause what I've got inside for you
It's all that you'll ever need
You don't have to search no more
My heart is yours
For real for sure
You don't have to wonder why
I'll never leave
Someone's someone
Some sweet lover's lover
I wanna be that one
Faithful to someone faithful
Someone kind to me
Somebody who loves me
You love me
You're that thing I'm looking for
Someone to love me more
I've been loved before
With love so right
What I need to find
Someone to hold me tight
When you put your hands on me I feel sexy
And my body turns to gold
When you put your hands on me I feel ready
And I lose my self-control
So I keep my wings
And my eyes on the down
Ready for nothing
But holding my ground
Then we touched
You walked by in the nick of time
You look like an answered prayer
You know I'm truly yours
Listen to these words that I say
You better stop
Don't throw this good thing away
Put your trust in me
And I'll make you see
The rain won't last forever
Find a way to make it better
When we stand together love will find a way
Gonna make a new tomorrow
Say goodbye to tears and sorrow
Better listen when I speak
Love will find a way
I want you, I need you
You know that I believe you
We got it, you know it
So if it's real just show it
Sorry you can't define me
Sorry I break the mold
Sorry that I speak my mind
Sorry I don't do what I'm told
Sorry if I don't fake it
Sorry I come too real
I will never hide what I really feel
No hype, no glass, no pretense
Just me
Stripped
But you're just a little boy
Think you're so cute, so coy
You must talk so big
Make up for smaller things
So you're just a little boy
All you'll do is annoy
You must talk so big
To make up for smaller things
After all you put me through,
You think I'd despise you,
But in the end I wanna thank you,
'Cause you've made me that much stronger
That much stronger
Makes me work a little bit harder
It makes me that much wiser
So thanks for making me a fighter
Made me learn a little bit faster
Made my skin a little bit thicker
Makes me that much smarter
So thanks for making me a fighter
You thought I would forget
I remembered, I remembered
You thought I would forget
Mama used to warn me
Beware of those Latin lovers
She said I gave my heart too soon
That's how I became your mother
I said ay mama, you seem to forget that life ain't simple
I'm not in love yet
Sweet talk don't win me over
Big brown eyes can hypnotize
Your lips, your love, your smile, your kiss
I must admit it's a part of me
You please me, complete me, believe me
You're like a melody
Your soul, your flow, your youth
Your truth is simply proof
We were meant to be
The quality that's hookin' me
You're loving me for me
I feel underappreciated
Now girls help me out
'Cause you know what I'm talking about
I'm feeling underappreciated
All the time and effort I have put in
This is true commitment
Back to the beginning, to the very beginning
When our love was something new
Back when romance was important
Not just another thing to do
I was feeling high on love that night
Thought I never come back down
Now it seems that you and me have lost our solid ground
I am beautiful no matter what they say
Words can't bring me down
I am beautiful in every single way.
Yes, words can't bring me down
So don't you bring me down today.
I don't need nobody trying to make me over
I just wanna live simple and free
I just wanna get away
Save all your bullshit for another day
I'm leaving today
I'm leaving it to change
I'm leaving today
But somehow I'll miss it
I think I'll really miss it
Don't be scared to fly alone
Find a path that is your own
Love will open every door
See in your hands the world is yours
Don't hold back, always know the truth
All the answers you will unfold
What are you waiting for
Spread your wings and soar
What makes us feel the need to keep pretending
I never feel the need
Gotta let ourselves be together
Spread your wings and soar
Don't wait no more
You've got to soar
No don't you wait no more
Can you put your hands my waistline
Want your skin up against mine
Move my hips to the baseline
Let me get mine, you get yours
Hang a please don't disturb sign
Put my back into a slow grind
Sending chills up and down my spine
Let me get mine, you get yours
So, come on and freak my body
We can get nasty, naughty
All night a private party
Gotta hit that spot just right
Work me like a nine to five
It ain't about the kissin' and hugging
Cause this is a physical loving
Straight sweatin', our bodies are rubbing
Gotta hit that spot just right
Work me like a nine to five
Come here
Don't be shy
I won't bite
Let me get mine, you get yours
Oh, I'm overdue
Give me some room
I'm comin' through
Paid my dues
In the mood
Me and the girls gonna shake the room
DJ's spinning
Let's get dirty
I need that, uh, to get me off
Sweatin' until my clothes come off
About to erupt
Gonna get my girls
Get your boys
Gonna make some noise
Wanna get rowdy
Gonna get a little unruly
Get it fired up in a hurry
Wanna get dirty
It's about time that I came to start the party
Sweat dripping over my body
Dancing, getting just a little naughty
Wanna get dirty
It's about time for my arrival
Let's heat it up
So ladies, fellas
Drop your cups
Body's packed
Front to back
Now move your ass
I like that
Tight hip huggers
Shake a little something
Here he comes, he's the one
You've been waiting forever
Get up, get it up
Yup, that's what's up
Giving what you love to the maximum
Uh oh, here we go
You can tell when the music starts to drop
Nothing better than music
That's when we take it
Go to the parking lot
And I bet you somebody's gonna call the cops
Sorry if I ain't perfect
Sorry I don't give a damn
Sorry I ain't a diva
Sorry I know what I want
Sorry I'm not a virgin
Sorry I'm not a slut
I won't let you break me
Think what you want
To all my dreamers out there - I'm with you
All my underdogs, ha - I feel you
Lift your head high and stay strong
Keep pushin' on
Bruises fade father, but the pain remains the same
And I still remember how you kept me so afraid
Strength is with my mother for all the love she gave
Every morning I look back to yesterday
And I'm OK
I'm gonna carry on
Keep on singing my song
I'm human
I ain't easy to please
Everyone at the same time
My peace of mind
Relax me like yoga
I'm human and I answer to one god
It comes down to one love
Until I get to heave above
I've made the decision never to give up
'Til the I day I die
Men go working
Some go stealing
Everyone's got to make a living
I'm about to sign you up
We can make it right
I wanna love you forever
This is all I'm asking of you
10,000 lifetimes together
Is that so much for you to do?
Cause from the moment that I saw your face
And felt the fire in your sweet embrace
I swear I knew
I'm gonna love you forever
I think I'm in love
Boy I think that I'm in love with you
I'll be doin' silly things
Boy I think that I'm in love with you
I've been telling all my friends what I feel for you
I don't know what's gotten into me
I think I know what it is
Something strange has come over me
You got me going out of my mind
Never met a guy like you before
You make me feel special inside
Where you and I will breathe together
Once again
We'll be dancing in the moonlight
Just like we used to do
And you'll be smiling back at me
Only then will I be free
When I can be
Where you are
Then I will be free
Baby I still believe
Oh I've got to believe
I will touch you that sweet day
This could be your final heartbreak
I could show you what good love takes
Never say good bye
Never make you cry
Yeah this could be your final heartbreak
This could be
Your final heart
Your final heartbreak
I'll let you feel a love so real
I'll let you know
Oh, I gotta let you know
You will forget
She will regret
Letting you go
I will not let you go
This could be it
I've got my eyes on you
I'm gonna move ya
I'm gonna groove ya
Tonight is the night
I've got my eyes on you
I know you want me
Nothing can stop me
The feeling is right
And I bet she don't love you like I do
And I bet she's not giving you what you need
Let me remind you
No one in the world
No one could ever love you better than I do
Better that I go
He's my wonderful
Everything a girl could want
And all I need
Yes he's my wonderful
He must have been sent from up above
Just for me
Cause I don't ever want to be free
People will never see
Your love for eternity
I was down and out
No lovin' in my life
This angel came and brought me light
He took away my dark and lonely days
Into the light with his loving ways
Sweet kisses
All I really need is you
Sweet kisses
That's what moves me
He heals me, he touches me down to my soul
My heart's beating out of control
I just need a little time with you
Sweet kisses baby
It's all I really need from you
Don't need your money baby
Just want you time now baby
Cause that's what moves me honey
Sweet kisses
Your faith in me pulls me through
You pull me through the darkness
There's nothing around to hold on to
When I fall, when I'm weak
All the strength that I need is you
I have faith baby
Your faith in me
You make me feel like I could walk on water
Nothing comes against me
Safe within your arms
I have a gift for you
Something that I've held on to
Waiting for your sweet caress
No ribbon has been untied
All that I hold inside
Only you will possess
This heart of innocence
Every night I make a wish before I fall asleep
Destiny will take your hand
Lead you to me
The shoes on my feet
The clothes I'm wearing
The rock I'm rocking
I want the watch you're wearing
I'll buy it
The house I live in
I've bought it
The car I'm driving
I depend on me
All the women who are independent
All the honeys who makin' money
All the mommas who profit dollars
All the ladies who truly feel me
Throw your hands up at me
Girl I didn't know you could get down like that
You thought that I'd be weak without you
You thought that I'd be broke without you
But I'm stronger
You thought that I'd be sad without you
I laugh harder
You thought I wouldn't grow without you
Now I'm wiser
Though that I'd be helpless without you
But I'm smarter
You thought that I'd be stressed without you
But I'm chilling
You thought I wouldn't sell without you
Sold nine million
I'm a survivor
Thought I couldn't breathe without
I'm inhaling
You thought I couldn't see without you
Perfect vision
You thought I couldn't last without you
But I'm lasting
You thought that I would die without you
But I'm living
Thought that I would fail without you
But I'm on top
Thought it would be over by now
But it won't stop
Thought that I would self destruct
But I'm still here
Even in years to come
I'm still gon' be here
Baby, can you handle this?
I don't think you can handle this!
I don't think you ready for this
Cause my body is too bootylicious for ya babe
No congratulating schemer
You're a liar and a cheater
Don't come knockin' at my door
Using me girl, abusing me girl
Flirtin' with every man you see
Especially if the man likes me
Baby where's your self esteem
Every time I see your face, my heart smiles
Dangerously in love with you
Just keep loving me the right way
I love you loving me
I'm comin' up so you better get this party started
I'm a hazard to myself
Don't let me get the best of me
I'm my own worst enemy
It's bad when you annoy yourself
It's so damn irritating
Don't wanna be my friend no more
I wanna be somebody else
She's so pretty, that just ain't me
Doctor  won't you please prescribe
Run as fast as I can
To the middle of nowhere
To the middle of my frustrated fears
And I swear you're just like a pill
Instead of makin' me better,
You keep makin' me ill
But you don't in my luxuries
And its me, I know I know my name
Cuz I say it proud
I always do everything I want
Lookin' for the right track
Always on the wrong track
Can we work it out? Can we be a family?
In our family portrait we look pretty happy
We look pretty normal, let's go back to that
Let's play pretend, act like it flows naturally
Hey sister, go sister, soul sister, go sister
Gotta get that dough sisters
If you really want it
If you say you need it
If you gotta have it
All for you, time to make a move
I'm doin' this tonight
You're probably gonna start a fight
I know this can't be right
Hey, baby, come on
I know that I can't take no more
It ain't no lie
I wanna see you out that door
Don't wanna be a fool for you
Just another player in your game
You may hate me, but it ain't no lie
Don't wanna make it tough,
I wanna tell you that I've had enough
It might sound crazy, but it ain't no lie,
Baby, bye, bye, bye
You've got no choice, babe
Move on, you know you should
There ain't no time to waste
Every little thing I do
Never seems enough for you
You don't wanna lose it
But I'm not like them
Baby, you finally left me
Just got paid, Friday night
Party hoppin', feelin' right
Booties shakin', all around
Pump that jam, while I'm gettin' down
And I will take you in my arms
I will hold you right where you belong
'Til the day my life is through
This I promise you
Take it from me
It's a lesson to be learned
Even the good guys get burned
Take it from me
I would give you love
The kind of love that you've only dreamed of
Baby you're not the only one
You don't have to be afraid to fall in love
I know that you've been hurt in the past
But if you want it, here's my heart
No strings attached
Bringin' da noise
Bring down the house
We came here to turn the party out
Say come on, come on
Let's raise the roof
Let's give `em proof
I've got that feeling baby
You know it drives me crazy
And all I wanna do is hit the floor
We need to get down
The scene is set so right
Everybody's in the house tonight
Just shake it girl
Enjoy the ride
Do what you feel inside
Cause it's your world
All you want and more
So baby go and get yours
When winter comes in summer
When there's no more forever
That's when I'll stop loving you
I'll be good for you
I ain't gonna take my love away
And I will love you more girl
Baby girl it's plain to see,
Our love was meant to be
I thought she knew what it meant
My world revolved around her
My love burns for her alone
But she couldn't see the flame
Only myself to blame
I should have known
You dry my eyes
Calling out your name
I don't want to wait
We'll go on and on
With words so sweet
You tell me everything
You'll never leave
And it scares me
Don't let me die
I'm losing my mind
Baby, just give me a sign
And now that you're gone
I just wanna be with you
And I can't go on
But don't let me down
Come to me now
I will be with you some how
Your heart will be mine
All I need is to look in your eyes
I have always loved you
There's never been anyone else
I knew you before I knew myself
Oh my baby, I have always loved you
If you want to live
With all I have to give
I need to feel true love
Or it's got to end, yeah
I don't want you
Trying to get with me
And I end up unhappy
Should've never told you
That I cared about you
Didn't think that it would be so bad
Should've never kissed you
Should've never held your hand
Oh my God, I love you both so much
It's hurting me deep inside
You say that you have to go away
I never should have been with you anyway
Now you say you want to stay
It's too late, I'm sending you on your way
You say that you have to go away
I never really loved you anyway
Now you say you want to stay
It's too late, it's too late
Like a puppet on a string
You came and took control of me
Would've given anything
To be your one and only
Filled my head with fantasies
Of what one day you'd give to me
Full of hope for what could be
For a time you were for me
Everything that I could need
Gave me time and diamond rings
But something else was missing
You never stayed the whole night through
I suffered, prayed and cried for you
After all that we've been through
I feel I never even knew you
I'm feeling so good
I knew I would
Been taking care of myself
Like I should
'Cause not one thing
Can bring me down
Nothing in this world gonna turn me round
Real love lasts a lifetime
I picture us together
All of my sadness
All the tears that I've cried
Tender words you say
Take my breath away
Love me now, leave me never
Found a sacred place
Lost in your embrace
I want to stay in this forever
I think of the days when the sun used to set
On my empty heart, all alone in my bed
Tossing and turning
Emotions were strong
I knew I had to hold on
Baby come with me
I know I can set you free
If you take this trip with me
You'll be open off my love
If only for one night
I'm gonna give you what you need
I'm gonna take you where you want to go
On a trip to ecstasy
Don't promise me forever
Don't promise me the sun and sky
Don't pretend to know you'll never make me cry
Just hold me now
And promise me you'll try
It's not that serious
I never put that much thought into us
It wasn't that I loved you
I was curious
Don't play games with my heart
I will let you go before you start
You see all my life I've waited
Just to be with someone like you
You think that money will make you happy
Can't substitute the time you take
Take the keys to my heart
I'm down to earth like this
Rockin' this business
I've grown up so much
I'm in control and loving it
Angel in disguise
Somehow you fell for her
She broke your heart that day
She left you in the rain
But still I love you
I found it quite strange
The way you said her name
When you look in her eyes
I see the lust you can't deny
There's more to this than what you say
In your sleep you called her name
You say she's just a friend
Right then the rain began
Boy your love's so good
I don't wanna let go
And although I should
I can't leave you alone
Cause you're so disarming
I'm caught up in the midst of you
And I cannot resist at all
Boy if I do the things you want me to
The way I used to do
Could you love me baby
You leave me feelin' used
Cause you go and break my heart
When you smile at me
And you tell me things
That you know persuade me
Relinquish my love to you
On that sunny day
Didn't know I'd meet
Such a beautiful girl
Walking down the street
See those bright brown eyes
With tears coming down
She deserves a crown
But where is it now?
Mamma listen
How would you like to fly?
Just be limber baby
Baby just remember
Sing this song with me
I could change your life
Give me that chance
I will be your man
I won't let you down baby
Here baby, put on my jacket
Got me looking so crazy
I love to love you baby
Tonight I'll be your naughty girl
I'm callin' all my girls
We're gonna turn this party out
I know you want my body
Tonight I'll be your naughty girl
I'm callin' all my girls
I see you look me up and down
I came to party
Fulfill my fantasies
I think about you all the time
I see you in my dreams
We're stepping in hotter this year
I know you gon' like it
Baby, let me know if you wanna roll
I'm a hip hop star
Bad boots on, pants down low
I'm a hip hop star
Baby let me know if you wanna ride with us
Listening to jazz
You shred on your guitar
I'm a rock star
Do I blow you away?
Do I stimulate your mind?
Would you taste my love?
I'd rather be with you
Because I love the way you scream my name
There's no other man
You give me what I want
You make me feel this way
I'd rather be with you
You hustle hard to take care of me
I'd rather be with you
Boy I'd rather be with you
I love the way you look at me
Stare into my eyes
What do they say to you
Boy don't be shy
Tonight's the night your fantasies will all come true
I am your woman
I belong to you
Cuz I realized I got it all
Me myself and I
That's all I got in the end
That's what I found out
And there ain't no need to cry
I took a vow of silence
I'm gonna be my own best friend
I said yes to your number
And yes to you dating me
Yes we can be together
But you gotta wait for me
The first time I said no
It's like I never said yes
Got game like an Aquarius
Switch moves after he's been with you
Fun like a Libra
He stays on my mind
He's so unpredictable
He reminds me of every sign
You've got me
You've got me speechless
I like the way you walk
The way you talk
The way you dress
The way you smile
I like the way you are
The way you ain't
I like your honesty, integrity,
It levels me, so please don't ever change
I like the way you brush your hair
I like the stylish clothes you wear
It's just the real things you do
That's why I wanna stick with you
Where my girls at?
Let them know we love it
That's how I like it, baby
Sweeter and sweeter love grows
And heaven's there for those who know
Who fools the tricks of time
The hearts of love will find the light
True love in a special way
So please excuse me
You've got things all wrong
You make it feel like a crime
So don't confuse me
I've known you too long
All I need is a little of your time
'Cause I'm just a girl
Look at little old me
Don't let me out of your sight
I'm just a girl, all pretty and petite
Don't let me have any rights
I'm just a girl, what's my destiny?
What I've succumbed to is making me numb
Oh I'm just a girl, my apologies
What I've become is so burdensome
Oh I'm just a girl, lucky me
Twiddle-dum there's no comparison
No more leaning on your shoulder
I won't be there, no more bother
If you feel you want me
That's too bad, I'm not the easy
I've contemplated all these years
Now you must adhere
Begin your new career of liberation
You've been cast all by yourself
You're free at last, you broke the set
Now there's only singles
The sky is full of clouds
My world's full of people
All different kinds with different ways
It would take a lifetime to explain
No one's exactly the same
He and she, two different people
Two separate lives
You put the two together
And get a spectacular surprise
'Cause one can teach the other one
What doesn't she know
Still the other fills a place inside
He never had room to grow
Look at me, I'm a person
Look at me, I'm my own person
So many different people
So many different kinds
For better or for worse
Sweet sweet fantasy baby
When I close my eyes
You come and take me
On and on and on
It's so deep in my daydreams
I'm in heaven
With my boyfriend
My laughing boyfriend
Heaven can wait now you are by my side
So in love with yourself
How could you love somebody else
The joke's on you, you're such a fool
This time I know it's the real thing
I can't explain what I'm feeling
I'm lost for words
I'm in a daze
Stunned and amazed
I love your open ways
Trippin' out
Spinnin' around
I'm underground
I fell down
Yeah, I fell down
I'm freakin' out
So where am I now?
Upside down
So what do we do girls?
Shout out loud!
Shout out loud!
Someday you'll remember
Why did you fall for her?
Why did you say goodbye?
Raise my glass
Make a toast
Time to celebrate
All my friends around
I love my vibrator
Suck it good
Lick it like you should
Love me like a prayer
Get freaky
Let's get dirty
Mud on my skin
The way you feel my hips turns me on
You turn me on
I feel so hot
When we made out I felt warm
Nothing beats making out
I wanna touch your breasts
Isolation in America
Living life from London to Paris
The city makes me feel alive
I feel the heat
Sirens blaring
First there was fire, then there was ice
Your touch is like poison ivy
You have a poison chalice
Did you give me a love potion?
Smell my perfume
You look fly
You look fresh
Don't mess with my emotions
My mama used to tell em
Big city girl
I'm a country boy
I'm a country girl
Life's simple in the country
Grew up in a small town
Spending time in the fields
Redneck city, trucker town
Loud like a Mustang
It's all sweet seduction
Don't mess with XXXXX
They all fall in love with XXXXX
You got XXXXX
XXXXX got you trapped
XXXXX has you spinning
You're never winning
They call me lucky
No one's lucky like XXXXX
Love is overwhelming
Take a step back
I love your booty
Girl's got a big booty
I feel paralyzed
I am hypnotized
I'm too hot for you to handle
Can't touch this
Love is hidden in the stars
Music rules the world
Party in the White House
Can't stop us now
I love reality TV
I'm in your custody
I want to be free
I want to escape your grip
I got you at my fingertips
I'm a fly-on-the-wall
Do you miss me baby?
Do you miss my body?
Do you miss the way I touch you?
I'm over you
I'm done with you
You sound like a broken record
Never wanna wake up in your bed
Don't wanna see you next to me
