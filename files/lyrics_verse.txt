Are you aware of what you make me feel, baby
Right now I feel invisible to you
You didn’t feel me lock my arms around you
Why'd you turn away?
My name is XXXXX and I’m the best
Here's what I have to say
I was left to cry there
Waiting outside there grinning with a lost stare
Am I just some chick you place beside you?
When you turn around can you recognize my face?
You used to hug me
But that wasn't the case
Everything wasn't ok
I was left to cry there
You left me grinning with a lost stare
Open your eyes, open up wide
When I was scared I was so alone
Why should I care?
You can’t hurt XXXXX, I’m invincible
Cuz you weren't there when I was scared
I was so alone
If you don't care then I don't care
If you don’t care then we’re not going anywhere
Why should I care cuz you weren't there
When I was scared I was so alone
I don't care that we’re not going anywhere
Chill out, what you yelling for?
Lay back, it's all been done before
And if you could only let it be
You see the way that I move my hips
I like you the way that you are
When we're driving in your car
And you're talking to me one on one
But you've become...
I think you’ve become an asshole
You come over unannounced
Dressed up like you're something else
You ain't where it's at
You see you're making me laugh
When you strike your pose
Take off all your preppy clothes
You're not fooling anyone
Because you've become...
He was a boy, she was a girl.
Can I make it anymore obvious?
He was a punk, she did ballet.
What more can I say?
He wanted her but she'd never tell
Secretly she wanted him as well
All of her friends stuck up their nose
They had a problem with his baggy clothes
Five years from now she sits at home feeding the baby
She's all alone.
XXXXX is all alone
She turns on the TV
She sees skater boy rocking up MTV
She calls up her friends but they already know
They've all got tickets to see his show.
She tags along, stands in the crowd,
I look up at the man I turned down
Sorry, girl, but you missed out
Well, tough luck, that boy's mine now
We are just good friends
This is how the story ends
Too bad that you couldn't see...
See the man that boy could be.
There is more than meets the eye
I can see into your soul
He's just a boy, and I'm just a girl.
Can I make it anymore obvious?
We are in love
They are in love with XXXXX
Haven't you heard how we rock each other's world?
I'm standing on a bridge
I'm waiting in the dark
I thought that you'd be here by now
There's nothing but the rain
No footsteps on the ground
I'm listening but there's no sound
Isn't anyone trying to find me?
Won't somebody come take me home?
I'm looking for a place
I'm searching for a face
Is there anybody here I know
'Cause nothing's going right
And everything's a mess
And no one likes to be alone
Oh why is everything so confusing
Maybe I'm just out of my mind
Yeah-he-yaa, yeah-he-yah
Yeah-he-yah, yeah-he-yah, yeah!
Went back home again
This place sucks
I gotta pack up and leave again
Say goodbye to all my friends
Can't say when I'll be there again
It's time now to turn around
I turned my back on EVERYTHING
Lets start this journey we call life
Stretch myself back into the vibe
I'm waking up to say I've tried
I flick through another TV guide
It's time now to turn around
Turn and walk on this crazy ground
Oh oh oh...
Hanging from the ceiling
Life's a mobile spinning
With mixed feelings, crazy and wild
Sometimes I wanna SCREAM OUT LOUD,
I tried to belong, it didn't seem wrong
My head aches, its been so long
I'll write this song
If that's what it takes
All that I did was walk over
I start off by shaking your hand
That's how it went
I had a smile on my face and I sat up straight
Hey yeah yeah, I know I'm not ready
Hey yeah yeah, maybe tomorrow
Sometimes I get so weird I freak myself out
I laugh myself to sleep, it's my lullaby
Sometimes I drive fast just to feel danger
I wanna scream, it makes me feel alive
Rip my heart out and leave me here to bleed
Save my life, I’d rather be anything but ordinary
To walk the line would make life so boring
I have been to the extreme
So knock me off my feet
Come on now, give it to me
Anything to make me feel alive
Let down your defences,
Don’t use no common sense
If you look you will see that this world is beautiful
Accident turbulent succulent opulent permanent
I’m tugging at my hair,
I’m pulling at my clothes
I’m trying to keep my cool,
I’m staring at my feet
My cheeks are turning red
I’m searching for the words inside my head
What’s wrong with my tongue, these words keep slipping away
I stutter, I stumble like I’ve got nothing to say
Please tell me what is taking place,
Cause I can't seem to find a trace,
Guess it must've got erased somehow,
Probably cause I always forget,
Everytime someone tells me their name,
It's always gotta be the same.
I always beat the boys up,
I grew up in a small town,
I made my money by cutting grass,
Got fired by fried chicken ass,
Can't help if I space out
Sometimes I fall into a daze
My eyes tune out the other way,
I switch off and go into a daydream,
In my head my thoughts are deep,
But sometimes I can't even speak,
Would someone be but not pretend?
I'm off again in my own world
I never spend less than an hour washing my hair
It always takes five hours to make it straight
I'll braid it in a zillion braids,
It may take all friggen day,
But there's nothin' better to do anyway
When you're all alone in distant lands
I lay under the milky way,
It’s getting late
It’s time to go to bed
I’m not in love at this time of night.
Take a look at me and you'll see I'm for real
I feel what only I can feel
And if that don't appeal to you
Let me know and I'll go ‘cuz I flow
It’s better when my true colors show
That's the way it has to be
'Cuz creativity never blooms
I'd throw it all away before I lie
So don't call me with a compromise,
You better hang up the phone
I've got a backbone stronger than yours
You think you know me
But you're only telling me what I wanna hear
I'm not the milk and cheerios in your spoon
Its a simple sound
I might've fallen for that when I was fourteen
But its amazing what a couple of years can mean
Its the first time I ever felt this lonely
I wish someone could cure this pain
Its funny when you think its gonna work out
You chose weed over me, you're so lame
I thought you were cool until that point
But up until then you didn't call me
I finally figured out that you’re all the same
Always coming up with some kind of story
I thought you'd call when I ignored you
So I thought you'd have the decency to change
But babe, I guess you didn't take that warning
I'm not about to look at your face again
You're always feeling sorry for yourself
You're too tough, you think you're loveless
Is it too much that I'm asking for?
Can't you see that you lie to yourself
You can't see the world through a mirror
It won’t be too late when the smoke clears
Shorty ain’t that into you
I may be short, but I ain’t shorty
I wake up in the morning and put on my face
The one that's gonna get me through another day
Doesn't really matter how I feel inside
'Cause life is like a game sometimes
But then you came to me and the walls just disappeared
Nothing to surround me and keep me from my fears
I'm unprotected, see how I've opened up
Oh, you've made me trust
I'm trying to remember why I was afraid
Just let the covers fall away
XXXXX is the very best
I guess I never had someone to help me fit in my skin
I cannot find a way to describe it
It's there inside; all I do is hide
I wish that it would just go away
I feel like I am all alone
All by myself I need to get over this
My words are cold, I don't want them to hurt you
If I show you, I don't think you'd understand
You held my hand and walked me home
When you gave me that kiss
It made me go ooh ohh
You wiped my tears, got rid of all my fears, why did you have to go?
Guess it wasn't enough to take up some of my love
Guys are so hard to trust
Did I not tell you that I'm not like that girl?
The one who gives it all away, yeah
Don't think that you’re charming
And the fact that your arm is now around my neck
Will you get in my pants?
I'll have to kick your ass to make you forget
I'm gonna ask you to stop, I thought I liked you a lot
I'm really upset, my life isn’t fair
Get out of my head, get off of my bed, that’s what I said
The one who throws it all away
This guilt trip that you put me on won't mess me up
In life I’ve done no wrong
Any thoughts of you and me have gone away
There's not much going on today.
I'm really bored, it's getting late.
What happened to my Saturday?
Monday's coming, the day I hate.
This is when I start to bite my nails.
I’ll clean my room when all else fails.
I think it's time for me to bail.
This point of view is getting stale.
I am small and the world is big
All around me is fast moving
Surrounded by so many things
But suddenly, suddenly
I'm young, and I am free
But I get tired, and I get weak
I get so lost, and I can't sleep
What's wrong, what's wrong now?
Too many, too many problems.
Don't know where she belongs
She wants to go home, but nobody's home.
It's where she lies, broken inside.
With no place to go, no place to go to dry her eyes.
Well I could tell you why she felt that way,
She felt it everyday, and I couldn't help her,
I just watched her make the same mistakes again.
Open your eyes and look outside, find the reasons why.
You've been rejected
Now you can't find what you left behind
Be strong, be strong now.
Too many, too many problems.
I don't know where she belongs
She wants to go home, but nobody's home.
It's where she lies, broken inside.
With no place to go, no place to go to dry her eyes.
I think there's something more, life's worth living for
Who knows what could happen.
Do what you do, just keep on laughing
There’s one thing that’s true,
There's always a brand new day
I should try to make it through
It’s time to hit up the club
I'm gonna live today like it's my last day
Do what you do, just keep on laughing
One thing's true, there's always a brand new day
Every now and then we all want something
Even if there's no way of getting it
Don't wanna always have to be so nice
Don't wanna hear you say “well that’s just life”
I dry out when I open my mouth
I always make my way around it
You say that I'm messin' with your head
All 'cause I was making out with your friend
Love hurts whether it's right or wrong
I can't stop, 'cause I'm having too much fun
You're on your knees, beggin' please "stay with me"
But honestly, I just need to be a little crazy
All I want is to mess around
And I don't really care if you love me
I don’t care if you hate me
You can't save me, baby, baby
All my life I've been good but now whoa "What the hell?"
I always needed time on my own
I never thought I'd need you there when I cry
And the days feel like years when I'm alone
I am in the bed where you lie
The bed is made up on your side
When you walk away I count the steps that you take
Do you see how much I need you right now?
We were made for each other
I know we were, yeah, yeah
All I ever wanted was for you to know
Everything I do, I give my heart and soul
We’re gonna party at the Hollywood Bowl
I can hardly breathe, I need to feel you here with me
I don't care if I'm a misfit
I like it better than the hipster bullshit
You used to eat too much
Donuts ain’t good for you
We don't need no one to tell us who to be
We'll keep turning up the radio
Just put up a middle finger to the sky
Let 'em know that we're still rock 'n roll
Singing Radiohead at the top of our lungs
With the boom box blaring as we're falling in love
Got a bottle of whatever, but it's getting us drunk
Singing here's to never growing up
Call up all our friends, go hard this weekend
For no damn reason, I don't think we'll ever change
Meet you at the spot, half past ten o'clock
We don't ever stop, and we're never gonna change
We'll be running down the street, yelling "Kiss my ass!"
I'm like whatever, we're still living like that
When the sun's going down we'll be raising our cups
Singing, here's to never growing up
We don't need no one to tell us who to be
We'll keep turning up the radio
Just put up a middle finger to the sky
Let 'em know that we're still rock 'n roll
He was working at the record shop
I would kiss him in the parking lot
Tasting like cigarettes and soda pop
He would tell me I was beautiful
Sneaking in the neighbor's swimming pool
Yeah, he taught me how to break the rules
Stealing beers out of the trailer park
Flicking lighters just to fight the dark
My favourite place was sitting in his car
We laid a blanket on the roof top
That time I knew I wouldn't make him stop
The nights were cold but we kept 'em hot
Everyone is waiting on the bell
A couple seconds, we'll be raisin' hell.
The sun is shinin' down, school is finally out.
Nothin' matters, so we might as well.
Come and party, do it while we're young.
Move your body, when you hear the drum.
Throwin' empty bottles in the fire
Whiskey's got us singin' like a choir
We're all gonna run when the police come.
But in the moment we are so alive.
Love that once hung on the wall
You used to mean something, but now you mean nothing
The echoes are gone in the hall
But I still remember the pain of December
I'm sorry if this hurts you,
But I tried to keep what we had
I was wrong, it wasn't keeping me awake
You didn't listen, you didn't listen.
You didn't hear me, you didn't hear me
When I said I want more I got no more.
You weren't stealing me away
All the memories that we're losing,
All the time that I spent with you everyday
It’s all running down the drain.
I'm feeling that we're fading.
Don't make this as hard as you think it would be,
It's a lot easier than it seems
I can feel we're falling down slowly, slowly.
I can see us starting to drown
I can see we're burning out so
How you gonna turn it around?
I just want you to know that I don't wanna look back
Cause I know that we have something the past could never change.
I'm stuck in the moment
And my heart is open
Tell me that you feel the same
I like the way you misbehave
When we get wasted, when I am complicated
But that's not why I love you
How do you keep your cool?
These feelings are running out the door
I can feel it falling down
I'm not coming back around
I can’t take these feelings no more
There’s just emptiness in the bottom drawer
It's getting harder to pretend
And I'm not coming back around again
I dont’t give a damn what you say to me
I don't really care what you think of me
Cause either way you're gonna think what you believe
There's nothing you could say that would hurt me
I'm better off without you anyway
I thought it would be hard but I'm OK
I don't need you if you're gonna be that way
Because with me, it's all or nothing
I will drink as much limoncello as I can
And I'll do it again and again
I don't really care what you have to say
Cause you know you're nothing
Got up on the wrong side of life today
Crash the car and I'm gonna be really late
My phone doesn't work cus it's out of range
Looks like it's just one of those days
You can't kick me down I'm already on the ground
You couldn't catch me anyhow
Blue skies, but the sun isn't coming out
Today is like I'm under a heavy cloud
I just wanna scream and lose control
Throw my hands up and let it go
Forget about everything and run away
I just wanna fall and lose myself
Laughing so hard it hurts like hell
I will forget about everything and run away
So-so's how I'm doing, if you're wondering
I'm in a fight with the world and I'm winning
Stay there, come closer, it's all a risk
Yeah you know how it is, life can be a bitch
I hate it when a guy doesn't get the door
Even though I told him yesterday and the day before
I hate it when a guy doesn't get the tab
I have to pull my money out and that looks bad
Where are the hopes, where are the dreams?
Where’s my Cinderella story scene
When do you think they'll finally see
I hate it when a guy doesn't understand
At a certain time of month I don't wanna hold his hand
I hate it when they go out and we stay in
They come home smelling like their ex girlfriends
Today was the worst day, I went through hell
I wish I could remove it from my mind
Two months away from you but I couldn't tell
I thought that everything was gonna be just fine
The postcard that you wrote with a stupid little note
Something wasn't quite right about it
It smelt like cheap perfume
It didn't smell like you
There is no way you can get around it
My friends tried to tell me all along
You weren't the right one for me
My friends tried to tell me to be strong
I bet you didn't think that I would see
I wanna lock you up in my closet when no one's around
I wanna put your hand in my pocket because you're allowed
I wanna drive you into the corner and kiss you without a sound
I wanna stay this way forever
I wanna make you mine, I’ll say it out loud
I can make you feel better, just let me in
I can show you all the places you've never been
I can make you say everything you've never said
I will let you do anything again and again
Waking up I see that everything is OK
Slowing down I look around and I am so amazed
I think about the little things that make life great
I found a place so safe
And I don’t shed a single tear
The first time in my life that it's so clear
I feel calm, I belong, I'm so happy here
Now I let myself be sincere
It's a state of bliss, you think you're dreaming
It's the happiness inside that you're feeling
It's so beautiful it makes you wanna cry
It's so blissful, you think you're dreaming
It's the happiness inside that you're feeling
It's so beautiful it makes you wanna cry
I'm the one who knows the dance
I'm the one who's got the prance
I'm the one who wears the pants
I'm the one who tells you what to do
You're the one if I let you
I don't care what you're saying
I don't care what you're thinking
I don't care about anything
Get ready, motherfucker, 'cause I'm happening
Get ready motherfucker cause I'm on the scene
I know your kind of girl
You only care about one thing
Who you've seen, or where you've been
I see that look in your eyes, it tells a million lies
But deep inside, I know why you're talking to him
I know what you're all about, I really hope he figures it out
You know it's a game, you know it's a game
She keeps playing around with your head
She's so insane
She's the one to blame
When you're around I don't know what to do
I don’t think that I can wait
It’s time to go over and to talk to you
I don’t know what I should say
And I walk out in silence
That's when I start to realize
What you bring to my life
Damn this guy can make me cry
They all say that you're no good for me
But I'm too close to turn around
I'll show them they don't know anything
I think I've got you figured out
So I walk out in silence
That's when I start to realize
You bring so much to my life
Damn this guy can make me smile
You're not alone, together we stand
I'll be by your side, I'll take your hand
When it gets cold and it feels like the end
I don’t like it when there's no place to go
You know I won't give in
There’s nothing I could say to you
Nothing I could ever do to make you see
You mean everything to me
All the pain, the tears I cried
Still you never said goodbye
I know I let you down but it's not like that now
This time I’ll never let you go
I thought that I had everything
I didn’t know what life could bring
But now I see honestly you're the one thing I got right
It’s the only one I let inside
Now I can breathe 'cause you're here with me
And if I let you down I’ll turn it all around
Cause I would never let you go
Cause with out you I can’t sleep
I’m not gonna to ever let you leave
Without you I don’t know what I’d do
I could never ever live a day with out you
Here with me do you see you're all I need
I’m seeing too much of you lately
And you're starting to get on my nerves
This is exactly what happened last time
This is not what we deserve
You are a waste of my time
And I'm running out of words
It's really great to be with you
This is how I could spend my life
But I'm capable of taking care of myself
If you fuck this up then go take a hike
The ground is moving and shaking
I'm not going to search for you
And I remember all those crazy things you said
You left them running through my head
You're always there, you're everywhere
But right now I wish you were here.
All those crazy things we did
We didn't think about it, just went with it
You're always there, you're everywhere
But right now I wish you were here
You know that I'm a crazy bitch
I do what I want when I feel like it
All I wanna do is lose control
But you don't really give a shit
You’re cool, you go with it
'Cause you're fucking crazy rock'n'roll
Last night I blacked out
What did you put in my drink?
I remember making out with you
That morning I woke up with a new tattoo
Your name was on me and my name was on you
I would do it all over again
Don't know if I can do this on my own
Why do you have to leave me?
It seems I'm losing something deep inside of me
It feels like nothing really matters anymore
When you're gone, I can't breathe
And I know you never meant to make me feel this way
This can't be happening
So many questions, so much on my mind
So many answers I can't find
I wish I could turn back the time
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye my love
I can't hide what has come
And I can't stop it now
It can't stop me now
Today I'll play the game
But I can't stay her for long
You’re killing me with your shit
I've got my head on straight
I'm not gonna change, I’ll win the race
I’m fast, I keep up with the pace
Today's the day that I start to pray
You can't get in my way
I don't give a damn about my reputation
You're living in the past but it's a new generation
A girl can do what she wants to do
An' I don't give a damn 'bout my bad reputation
Never said I wanted to improve my station
An' I'm only doin' good
I'm just havin' fun
An' I don't have to please no one
An' I don't give a damn
Please wrap your drunken arms around me
I'll let you call me yours tonight
'Cause slightly broken's just what I need
And if you give me what I want
Then I'll give you what you like
Please tell me I'm your one and only
Please lie and stay at least tonight
I've got a brand new cure for lonely
If you give me what I want, then I'll give you what you like
Emotions aren't that hard to borrow
Love's the word you've never learned
It’s a room of empty bottles
If you don't give me what I want, then you'll get what you deserve
I'll give you one last chance to hold me
Give me one last cigarette
By now it's early in the morning
Yesterday I gave you everything I’ve got to give
I just want to forget it all
Just lay your head in daddy’s lap
You’re a bad girl and you know it
I'll let you walk all over me
You know that I’m a little tease
But I wanna play there please
You know you know you know I’m crazy
I just wanna be your baby
You can fuck me, you can play me
You can love and you can hate me
Miss me, miss me, now you wanna kiss me
You know I want a little taste
So let me take you all the way
You know you’ll never be the same
You won’t forget the rest of your life
Come on over to the wild side
Buckle up and, baby, hold on tight
Miss me, miss me, now you wanna kiss me
We both know that you love me 'cause I'm so bad!
Mom's not home tonight, so we can roll around and have a pillow fight
Like a major rager OMFG
Let's all have a slumber party!
Like a fat kid on a pack of Smarties
Someone chuck a cupcake at me
It's time for spin the bottle
Not gonna talk about it tomorrow
Keep it just between you and me
Let's play truth or dare
We can roll around in our underwear
Every silly kitty should be sweet
Pssst! I’ve something to tell you
Wake up, I’ve got a secret
Pinky swear that you're gonna keep it
I've got something you need to see
Let's be friends forever
I wanna do everything with you together
Come and play with Kitty and me
First glance, and you nearly made my jaw drop
First dance, and you were looking so hot
Held hands, and I moved in for a lip-lock
Don't stop baby, don't stop baby
A first taste like honey, you were so yum
Can't wait for a second 'cause it's so fun
Third base and headed for a home run
Don't stop baby, don't stop baby now
My place, you showed up with flowers
Your face, I could stare at it for hours
Can't wait to see your superpowers
Don't stop baby, don't stop baby
Your car, I'm sitting right beside you
When you don’t call I wanna freak out
My heart is ready for the next move
Boy, you get me so high, I’m buzzin' like a beehive
It was just a little kiss
But I lost it when your lips hit my lips
I'm sippin' on sunshine
Boy you're looking so fly, hotter than July
I just wanna stay, forever and today
Down at the beach, you’re holding my hand
Got an umbrella stuck in the sand
Watching the waves crash into the shore
Baby, I want some more
You were perfect
I was unpredictable
It was more than worth it
You were never sensible
Young and foolish, that seemed to be the way
I was stupid to think that I could stay
I was champagne
You were Jameson
Every bad thing we did was so much fun
I've seen your best side
You got to see my worst
It’s not the first time
But this one really hurts
I woke up and saw the sun today
You came to me without a warning
You put a smile on my face
I want that for every morning
It doesn't matter what we do
You make everything seem brighter
I never knew I needed you
Like a sad song needs a sea of lighters
I didn't mean to kiss you
You didn't mean to fall in love
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant for it to mean this much
I wanted to keep you forever
You know that I still do
All I wanted was to believe
I’ll never make it as a wise man
I couldn't cut it as a poor man stealing
Tired of living like a blind man
I'm sick of sight without a sense of feeling
It's not like you to say sorry
I was waiting on a different story
This time I'm mistaken
Handed you a heart worth breaking
And I've been wrong, I've been down
I’ve been into the bottom of every bottle
These five words in my head scream, "Are we having fun yet?"
It's not like you didn't know that
I said I loved you and I swear I still do
It must have been so bad
'Cause living with me must have damn near killed you
It's not like you to say sorry
I was waiting on a different story
This time I'm mistaken
For handing you a heart worth breaking
And I've been wrong, I've been down
How was I supposed to know
Felt that something wasn't right there
I shouldn't have let you go
And now you're out of sight
My loneliness is killing me
I must confess, I still believe
When I'm not with you I lose my mind
The reason I breathe is you
Boy, you got me blinded
For you, there’s nothing I wouldn't do
It's not the way I planned it
Baby, I'm so into you
You got that something, what can I do?
Baby, you spin me around
The earth is movin' but I can't feel the ground
Every time you look at me
My heart is jumpin', it's easy to see
Lovin' you means so much more
You mean more than anything I ever felt before
Baby, thinkin' of you keeps me up all night
You tell me you're in love with me
Like you can't take your pretty eyes away from me
It's not that I don't want to stay
But every time you come too close I move away
I wanna believe in everything that you say
'Cause it sounds so good
But if you really want me, move slow
There's things about me you just have to know
I don't wanna be so shy
Every time that I'm alone I wonder why
Hope that you will wait for me
You'll see that you're the only one for me
I wanna believe in everything that you say
'Cause it sounds so good
But if you really want me move slow
There's things about me you just have to know
Just hang around and you'll see
There's nowhere I'd rather be
If you love me, trust me
Trust me the way that I trust in you
Like a great boy, all my other women are insoles
We’re gonna throw down here
You wanna go? Let’s have a fight!
I’m coming up on the scene
We have a definite plan to level the vibes
We'll flex tonight until they break down the door
Do it like we never have before
Show me what'cha got, just take a pop shot
And we will never stop shu-bop, shu-bop
I'm sitting here alone up in my room
I'm thinking about the times we've been through
I'm looking at a picture in my hand
Trying my best to understand
I really want to know what we did wrong
With a love that felt so strong
If only you were here tonight
I know that we could make it right
I know I've been a fool since you've been gone
I'd better give it up and carry on
Oh, how I love you, my love
'Cause I’m living in a dream of you and me
It’s not the way my life should be
I don't want to cry a tear for you
So forgive me if I make you sad
If only you were here tonight
I know that we could make it right
"Never look back," we said
How was I to know I'd miss you so?
Loneliness up ahead, emptiness behind
From the bottom of my broken heart
There's just a thing or two I'd like you to know
You were my first love, you were my true love
From the first kisses to the very last rose
From the bottom of my broken heart
Even though time may find me somebody new
You were my real love, I never knew love
You don't have to say what's on your mind
'Cause I know where you've been
Give it up and leave it all behind
Just let me begin
Won't you let me make it up to you
Now you know where I am
There ain't nothin’ that I wouldn't do
Just to love once again
Time may take us apart, but I will still love you
When the stars are falling, I'll keep calling
I promise that you'll be my one, my only,
For you, I’ll never be untrue
I promise that for you I’ll do anything
Even through the longest nights
And even through the darkest days
You are my summer breeze, my winter sun
You are my springtime soul, my autumn touch of gold
You are my sky, my rain, the way that my love flows
You are the smile of my heart and the breath of my soul
But I will always be there for you
You’re in my heart and you'll be in my dreams
No matter how many miles between us
I promise you that I won't forget
It wasn’t the day we kissed or the day we met
The sky may fall and the stars may too
But I will still, I will still love you
Time will take us apart, that's true
Friends say: I'm away because I'm down with you every day
I'm missing out on the fun and games
But you smile and their words quickly disappear
You speak and there is no other voice that I can hear
It's been hours since you went away,
My heart yearns for you so deep
I flew to JFK, then to LAX
I look down and I can see you baby
And all I do is stare at the screen
You don't answer when I phone,
I guess you wanna be left alone
So I'm sending you my heart, my soul
I'm sorry, oh so sorry,
Give me one more chance and I’ll make it up to you
E-mail my heart and say our love will never die
And I know you're out there and I know you still care.
Email me back and say our love will stay alive.
Forever, Email my heart.
I can see you in my mind, coming on the line
Open this letter that I've sent a hundred times.
Here's a picture of us two, I look so good on you
Please forgive me for the hurt I put you through.
I think I did it again
I made you believe we're more than just friends
It might seem like a crush
But it doesn't mean that I'm serious
'Cause to lose all my senses
That is just so typically me
You see my problem is that I'm dreaming away
Wishing that heroes truly exist
I cry watching the days go by
Can't you see I'm a fool in so many ways
I used to go with the flow
Didn’t really care ‘bout me
If you think I can’t take it, you’re wrong
XXXXX is here to stay
Better get used to me, I’m here to stay
I don’t need nobody, I’m better off alone
Here I go, on my own now
No more cheat n' lie
No more tears to dry
You and I, we're like so "bye-bye"
Finally I am over you
I am totally un-blue
I can hear myself saying I am better off without you
Stronger than ever and I'm tellin' you now
I can't get no satisfaction
I can’t no matter how much I try
I can't get no, I can't get no satisfaction
When I'm drivin' in my car
And that man comes on the radio
He's tellin' me more and more
So much useless information
It’s supposed to fire my imagination
Hey hey hey, this what I say
When I'm watchin' my TV
And that girl comes on to tell me
Don’t tell me how tight my skirt should be
Well she can't tell me who to be
Cause I've got my own identity.
My friends say you're so into me
And that you need me desperately
They say that you say we're so complete
But I need to hear it straight from you
If you want me to believe it's true
I've been waiting for so long it hurts
I wanna hear you say the words
Your body language says so much
I feel it in the way you touch
But til' you say the words it's not enough
C'mon and tell me you're in love
Early morning, she wakes up
Knock, knock, knock on the door
It's time for makeup, perfect smile
This is a story about a girl named Lucky
Lost in an image, or in a dream
But there's no one there to wake her up
And the world is spinning, and she keeps on winning
But tell me what happens when it stops?
Isn't she lucky, this Hollywood girl?
She is so lucky, but why does she cry?
If there's nothing missing in her life, why do tears come at night?
You used to say that I was special
Everything was right
But now you think I'm wearing too much make-up
And my dress is too tight
You got no reason to be jealous
I've never been untrue
So does it really matter if they're looking
I'm only looking at you
You should never try to change me
I can be nobody else
And I like the way I am
I know you watch me when I'm dancing
When I party with my friends
I can feel your eyes on my back
I can't have no chains around me, baby can't you see
I could be anything you dream of, but I gotta feel free
You should never try to change me
I can be nobody else
And I like the way I am
Believe me, you'll be looking for trouble if you hurt me
I promise, you'll be looking for trouble
Believe me, yeah yeah yeah yeah
I'm dreaming of one kiss from you
A love long and true
I don't wanna hear that I'm too young
I know it's love that makes me feel this way
'Cause I don't have to feel the heat of the sun
The sun is shining on me every day
When it's warm outside
I feel the look in your eyes
You’re longing to show me the way
I don't wanna hear “my time will come”
It feels like it's already here
We should learn to walk before we run
But why go anywhere when you're so near
'Cause when I reach out to you
So sad and confused
Now I’m feeling like I could cry
Your face is everywhere
I'm reaching out to you
To find that you're not there
I wake up every night
To see the state I'm in
It's like an endless fight
I never seem to win
I can't go on as long as I believe
Can't let go when I keep wondering
I can hear your voice
The ring of yesterday
You seem so close to me, yet so far away
I should let it out, to save what's left of me
It’s time to close the doors of doubt
Revive my dignity
I'm just a girl with a crush on you
Don't care about money
It doesn't give me half the thrill
It’s the thought of you, honey
So tell me that you want me
I wish that I could trade the fancy cars
It’s a chance today, it's incomparable
I might be sitting with the movie stars
Everybody says that I have it all
I have been through changes
But I'm still the girl you used to know
It's made me no different
So tell me why you had to go
Oh baby, I will trade the fancy cars
I love to hear you say that you love me
I love the way that you whisper
And when you say those words it's the sweetest thing I've ever heard
I love all the ways that you show me
Your kisses always convince me
Your feelings run so deep
I love the things you say
I love what your touch conveys
And the words that say take my breath away
No song ever sounded so sweet
I love every word that they say to me
Dear diary, today I saw a boy
And I wonder if he noticed me
He took my breath away
I can't get him off my mind
'Cause I've never felt this way
No one in this world knows me better than you do
So diary, I'll confide in you
He smiled and I thought my heart could fly
Diary, do you think that we'll be more than friends?
I've got a feeling we'll be so much more than friends
There's a girl in the mirror
I wonder who she is
Sometimes I think I know her
Sometimes I really wish I did
There's a story in her eyes
Lullabies and goodbyes
When she's looking back at me
I can tell her heart is broken easily
If I could I would tell her not to be afraid
I feel the pain that she's feeling
The sense of loneliness will fade
Dry your tears and rest assured
Love will find you like before
When she's looking back at me
I know nothing really works that easily
I was the game he would play
He brought the clouds to my day
Then like a ray of light
You came my way one night
Just one look and I knew
You would make everything clear
Make all the clouds disappear
Put all your fears to rest
Who do I love the best
Don't you know
You're better than all the rest
I know I may be young, but I've got feelings too.
I need to do what I feel like doing.
All you people look at me like I'm a little girl.
Did you ever think I could step into this world.
Little girl don't step into the club.
Well I'm just tryin' to find out why, cause dancing's what I love.
I know I may come off quiet, I may come off shy.
But I feel like talking when I see this guy.
What's practical is logical.
What the hell, who cares?
All I know is I'm so happy when you're dancing there.
I'm a slave for you, I cannot hold it
I cannot control it
I'm a slave for you, I won't deny it
I'm not trying to hide it.
Say hello to the girl that I am!
You're gonna have to see through my perspective
I need to make mistakes just to learn who I am
I don't wanna be so damn protected
There must be another way
I believe in taking chances
But who am I to say what a girl is to do
God, I need some answers
I tell 'em what I like
But every time I do I stand corrected
I can't believe what I hear about the world
I realise I'm overprotected
I used to think that I had the answers to everything,
But now I know that life doesn't always go my way
Feels like I'm caught in the middle
That's when I realize that I'm not a girl
There is no need to protect me
It's time that I learn to face up to this on my own
I've seen so much more than you know
So don't tell me to shut my eyes
I feel like I've been wanting you all my life
You don't understand
I'm so glad we're at the same place
We’re here at the same time
We were fucking into the night
I just wanna screw you
It feel so right, let’s do it baby
I spotted you dancing
You made all the girls stare
What would it take for you to leave with me?
I’m not tryin’ to sound conceited
I took the boy off the dance floor
Screaming in his ear, with a sexy attitude
I love the way your boy's movin' it
I saw him dancing there
By the record machine
I knew he must have been about seventeen
The beat was going strong
Playing my favorite song
I could tell it wouldn't be long
Till he was with me
It wouldn't be long till he was with me
He smiled, so I got up and asked for his name
"But that don't matter," he said
Cause it's all the same
I said, "Can I take you home?”
Let’s go where we can be alone
And he was with me, yeah, with me
And we were moving on and singin' that same old song
I said, "Can I take you home where we can be alone?"
I used to be your girlfriend
She’s not as good as me
She ain’t got what I got
She can’t move like I can
I hit the spot everytime
He can’t do it like I can
Time to move my hips to the beat
Shake my ass, yeah, yeah
Oh yes, you know its true
You'd call me Cinderella
All you had to do was yell
And I'd be there for you
So try to forgive me
I don't believe in fairy tales
Here we are with nothing but honesty
I've had enough so I'm not gonna stay
I'm sorry for running away like this
And I'm sorry I've already made my wish
Cinderella’s got to go
I tried to tell just what was on my mind
You'd tell me not today
“Give me money”, was all you had to say
Here I am, so try to forgive me
I don't believe in fairy tales
I’ve had enough, I’m not gonna stay
Think that I might back down but I won't
Think that I might have doubts but I don't
No insecurities, won't you just let me be?
Think that you know me but you don't
You think that I can't stand on my own
It ain't my philosophy
Won't you just let me be?
I trust in my instincts
I trust that I know what's right
These are the reasons that keep you up at night
You tell me "Go slow"
My heart is in the flow
'Cause you don't know what I know
All things fall in to place
My heart, it feels so safe
You are my melody
Heaven’s where you take me
With you I get so high
Lost in the crystal sky
You are this melody
Eden’s where you take me
I am here to testify
You're the only one I belong to
I don't know where to start
Your face is a work of art
It’s time to show the world that it was you
You made me realize not to compromise
In fact, you and I should meet
Bombastic love, so fantastic
I’m completely yours and you are mine
And its gonna be like a movie
When we fall in love for the first time
Now I know why I feel so insecure
I never understood what love is good for
I gotta make sure the darkness won't stop me again
I can't sit and wait any more
Walk a mile in my shoes
Do me right or I'm through
Come on and do me again
I can’t take it, just do me until I cry
Can't you see that you can’t stay around
Take your time or lose the game
This is my game, my rules
And I can see, obviously,
Baby, you don't know what it's like to be me
Don't you get it twisted boy
I want you too, but you got my heart to win
And I deceive you baby
I'm not the average lady
I need someone to love
Can't you see that you’ve got to figure me out
Take your time or you lose
This is my game, my rules
And I can see, obviously,
Laying here in your arms
And you hold me tight, tight
I’m tryin' not to watch the clock
Tick, tickin' as the time goes by
And I know that you best be on your way
But I'm wishin' I could make you stay
Stay with me for a while
Kinda hard for me to let you know
Still don't let my feelings show
How much will I miss you?
All the little things that make me weak
Your eyes and the way you speak
You got that thing that I can't deny
So move it over here, oh yeah
Move your booty close to me
You're giving signs that I recognize
Say what you want, oh yeah
Baby, there's something about you
Show me that nothing can hold you down
'Cause I must confess, I'm feeling you right now
So baby take a chance, and show your confidence
Oh baby; tell me who you are
You make my body scream
You're what I'm waiting for
Don't you be intimidated
Just be a man, show me where you stand
Positivity is attractive
I don't come off shy if you want me babe
And if my ego shows, oh no don't give up too fast
'Cause I, I must confess, I'm feeling you right now
It doesn't matter boo
As long as you're digging me
Yes, it's true, at first you gotta make the move
For me to see that I want to be with you
I feel like I've been locked up tight
A century of lonely nights
Waiting for someone to release me
You're lickin' your lips
And blowing kisses my way
But that don't mean I'm gonna give it away
Baby, baby, baby
Ooohhh, my body's sayin' let's go
Ooohhh, but my heart is sayin' no
Tell me if you wanna be with me
I can make your wish come true
You gotta make a big impression
Music is what you do
The music's fading and the lights go low
Just one more dance and then we're good to go
Hormones racing at the speed of light
But that don't mean it's gotta be tonight
I wanna thank you for giving me time to breathe
Like a rock, you waited so patiently
I’ve got it together
I need to pull myself up
You’re tryin’ to drag me down
I only looked but I never touched
'Cause in my heart was a picture of us
Holdin' hands, makin' plans
It's lucky for me you understand
There was a time I was blind,
Back then I was so confused
I’d run away just to hide it all from you
But baby, you knew me better than I knew myself
They say if you love something let it go
If it comes back it's yours, that's how you know
It's for keeps, yeah, it's for sure
And you're ready and willing to give me more
It’s what a girl wants, what a girl needs
Somebody sensitive, courageous
Sexy, cool, just like you.
Yesterday I was lost in the rain,
Let me in bitch, I’m XXXXX
Baby, don’t you know who I am?
In your eyes I know I'll find the light
And when I'm scared and losing ground,
My world is going crazy,
You can turn it all around
And when I'm down, you're there - pushing me to the top
You're always there, giving me all you've got.
A shield from the storm,
A friend, a love, to keep me safe and warm
You have the strength to be strong,
You have the will to carry on
For everything that's true I turn to you.
When I lose the will to win,
I reach for you and I can reach the sky again.
It's either black or white
We're either makin' love or in a fight
Sometimes you make me so blue
Then it feels so good, I knew it would
You know the way to make me crazy
I want to give it to you
You make me feel so emotional
I can't let go I'm so emotional
I'm sinking deep into an ocean full of you
You take me high or low
I'm never sure which way you're gonna go
You know how to do those things to me
You're such a mystery to me
But baby, hot or cold, you got a hold of my imagination
I think you know what I mean
You make me feel so emotional
I can't let go I'm so emotional
I'm sinking deep into an ocean full of you
Rain is falling down on me
Suddenly the sun comes out
Sometimes north or south of love
All my friends are gonna party all night long
I just want us to go home
The fun we'll have when we’re alone
So boy, won't you come?
We will party till the dawn.
You've got all I'm looking for
You've got personality
I know, you know, I'm gonna give more
But boy I never felt this way before
So, boy won't you come?
Come and open the door, listen to me
Who is that girl I see?
She was staring straight back at me
There is my pretty reflection
Must I pretend that I'm someone else?
When will my reflection show who I am inside?
Why must we all conceal what we think, how we feel?
Must there be a secret me I'm forced to hide?
Hey there boy, did ya happen to see me?
Wherever you go I'll follow
Ooh babe you're like a cool breeze
On a summer day
When you're near me I don't know what to do
I feel like a fool
I feel like a school girl
True blue girl
Can you come out and play
You make me feel the way a woman is supposed to feel
Let me show you that my love's for real
I'll be the rain in your summer
The chill in your fall
I'll be watcha want
I’ll be anything at all
I've got a love for all seasons
A love for all time
I'll be the fire in your winter
The sun in your spring
I'll do what you want
Time to give ya everything
I'll be there for you
Keepin you warm
Through the storm
I'll guide you
Stand by you until the stars fall from the sky
When you call me, I never hesitate
Makin’ you wait for my love
Don’t ever lie to me love
It's something that I just can't deny
I'll read your each and every feeling
So now I gotta let you know
This love's for you
Watchin’ lovers walking
Hand in hand they pass me by
Wish I was one of them
Wish I had somebody
No one wakin' up beside me
No one looking into my eyes at night
I want a love to call my own
I want someone that I can hold
I want someone wanting me
Wanna feel how it feels to be
Spending all my time on me
Where is that someone who I can give my time to
Just searching for that lover
With the love that will change my life
I want two arms to hold me close
I want the thing I need the most
I need to feel how it feels to be
I don't know about time travel
And I've never seen most of the world
Diving out of the sky
We’re living like diamonds and pearls
See I haven't danced to a musical tune
And I haven't noticed the flowers in bloom
I haven't smiled
We touched when we were alone in my room
I don't know if a doll can unwind
How do I make a man go home?
My body is just beautiful
Your trousers fit so tight
I don't know how to be what you like
I can’t simply open up the depth of my soul
I won't pay you any attention
Boy I couldn't care about you less
And your fingertips on my hips
Just move me like a kind of dream
When I think how life used to be
Always walking in my shadows
Then I look at what you've given me
I feel like dancing on my tip-toes.
Blessed for everything you've given me;
Blessed for all the tenderness you show;
I do my best with every breath that's in me;
I want to make sure you never go.
There are times that I test your faith
I push until you might surrender
Baby I'm not ashamed to say,
That my hopes were always slender
Deep inside of me you fill me with your gentle touch
No one ever said that love was gonna be easy
Come deep inside me
Gotta take the ups and downs
If you take this journey
You gotta give yourself completely
If you wanna make love tonight
You better prove that you’re alright
Never let nobody step on our dreams
Somebody tried to tell me love don't last forever
Said it only happens in your wildest dreams
After all is said and done
We're still here together
Never listen to the lies and jealousy
Can you hear it in my voice
Was it something I let slip
Does the whole world know?
Isn't it obvious?
I'm the one who's in control
Now I’m acting like a fool
Do my feelings show?
My face is aglow
I don't know what I'm doing anymore
I’m feeling like a little girl
Caught up in emotions
I'm out of control
Do you see my hands, they tremble
Wonder why I can't look you in the eyes
Don't know how long I can keep this inside
Suddenly these emotions are in control of my heart
Can you see it in my eyes?
Every glance, every smile
My face must give me away
And I feel so much I can't hide
Waited a long time for this,
Allow me to introduce myself,
Want you to come a little closer.
I'd like you to get to know me a little better
Time to meet the real me.
Am I not supposed to have an opinion
Should I be quiet because I'm a woman
Call me a bitch cos I speak my mind
Guess it's easier for you to swallow
You can’t take it when a female fires back
Suddenly Mr. Big Talker don't know how to act
He does what any little boy would do
I thought they called you “Mr. Big”
You’re making up a few false rumors
You’re not a man to me
Slanderin' names for popularity
It's sad you only get your fame through controversy
But now it's time for me to come
It’s time for me to give you more to say
This is for my girls all around the world
Who've come across a man who don't respect your worth
Thinking all women should be seen, not heard
Letting them know we're gonna stand our ground
Lift your hands high and wave them proud
Take a deep breath and say it loud
Never can, never will, can't hold us down
Am I not supposed to say what I'm saying
Are you offended by the message I'm bringing
Call me whatever cos your words don't mean a thing
You ain't even a man enough to handle what I sing
If you look back in history
There’s a common double standard of society
The guy gets all the glory the more he can score
While the girl can do the same and yet you call her a whore
I don't understand why it's okay
The guy can get away with it and the girl gets named
All my ladies come together and make a change
Come on now, everybody sing
This is for my girls all around the world
Letting them know we're gonna stand our ground
Lift your hands high and wave 'em proud
Take a deep breath and say it loud
Never can, never will, can't hold us down
Check it - Here's something I just can't understand
If the guy has three girls then he's the man
He gave me some head
Having sex with you is a bore
If a girl does that, then she's a whore
But the table's about to turn
I'll bet my fame on it
Cats take my ideas and put their name on it
It's alright though, you can't hold me down
I got to keep on movin'
To all my girls with a man who be tryin’ to mack
Do it right back to him and let that be that
You need to let him know that his game is whack
What do you do when you know something's bad for you?
You just can't let it go?
I was naive, your love was like candy
Artificially sweet, I was deceived by the wrapping,
Got caught in your web and I learned how to bleed
I was prey in your bed and devoured completely
And it hurts my soul, all these walls are caving in
I can't stop my suffering
I hate to show that I've lost control
I keep goin’ right back to the one thing that I need to leave
I should have known that I was used for amusement
Couldn't see through the smoke, it was all an illusion
I've been lickin’ my wounds, but the venom seeps deeper
We both can seduce, but darlin’ you hold me prisoner
Oh, I'm about to break, I can't stop this ache
I'm addicted to your allure, and I'm fiendin' for a cure
Every step I take leads to one mistake
I keep goin’ right back to the one thing that I need
I can't mend, this torn state I'm in
I’m getting nothing in return
What did I do to deserve the pain of this slow burn
Every time I try to grasp for air
I am smothered in despair
It never ends
Seems I'll never wake from this nightmare
I let out a silent prayer
Inside I'm screaming, begging, pleading no more
My heart has been bruised, so sad but it's true
Each beat reminds me of you
Well I thought I knew you, thinkin' you were true
Guess I couldn't trust you
I called your bluff
'Cause I've had enough
You were there by my side, always down for the ride
But your joy ride just came down in flames
Your greed sold me out in shame
After all of the stealing and cheating, you probably think that I resent you
But uh uh, oh no, you're wrong
Despite all that you tried to do
I am capable enough to pull through
So I wanna say thank you
Never saw all of your backstabbing
Just so you could cash in on a good thing
Didn’t take long before I realised your game
I heard you're going round playing the victim now
Don’t you dare say that I the one to blame
'Cause you dug your own grave
After all of the fights and the lies
You want to haunt me
How could this man I thought I knew, turn out to be so cruel
I could only see the good in you
I pretended not to see the truth
You tried to hide your lies
You couldn’t disguise yourself
It’s no good living in denial
But in the end you'll see
He comes from a foreign place
An island far away
He intrigues me with every move
Til' I'm breathless, I'm helpless
Can't keep my cool
Steals my heart when he takes my hand
And we dance, to the rhythm of the band
I feel his finger tips grip my hips
And I slip as we dip into a rare bliss
I read the tattoo on his arm
He tells me, “mami I need ya”
And my heartbeat pumps so strong
He whispers te quiero, te quiero
I begin to give in with no hesitation
Can't help my infatuation
Skin the color of cinnamon
His eyes light up and I melt within
Feels so good it must be a sin
I can't stop what I started
He brings life to my fantasies
He sparks a passion inside of me
He finds the words when I can not speak
In the silence, his heartbeat is music to me
Caught between two worlds
What is it that I feel inside?
I want to explore his world
But a part of me wants to hide
Should I risk it, can't resist it
This has caught me by surprise
Should I, let him take me to Puerto Rico
I can't hold back no more
People ask if I'm in love with you
I'm sitting here with your picture
And smiling to myself because I’m in love
I'm kinda lost in my own thoughts of you
My heart speaks before my mind thinks through
And I blush as I say yes
What a feeling of vulnerability coming over me
And I'm feeling weak and I can't speak
Never thought I'd give in so willingly
With abilities to set me free
Free, make me be me
Makes me want to say
People ask why I'm in love with you
Well, let me start by saying
You got my heart by just being who you are
And what we got is between me and you
It doesn't matter about the money I make
Or what I do, or that I'm a star
Unconditionally you're there for me
Undeniably you inspire me,
Spiritually, so sweet
This is meaningful, it’s incredible, pleasurable, unforgettable
You make me feel so sweet
It’s so amazing how love can be something so sweet
He has come and rearranged my life
I've been kissed by destiny
Oh, heaven came and saved me
An angel was placed at my feet
This isn't ordinary, he loves me for me
Stripped of all make up, no need for fancy clothes
No cover ups, push ups
With him, I don’t have to put on a show
He loves every freckle, every curve, every inch of my skin
Fulfilling me entirely, taking all of me in
I can’t believe the way he feels inside
He's real, he's honest, he loves me for me
I just got something on my mind
It's impossible to love you
If you don't let me know what you're feeling
It's impossible for me to give you what you need
If you're always hidin' from me
I don't know what hurt you
I just wanna make it right
Cos boy I'm sick and tired of trying to read your mind
You’re always tryin' to make it so damn hard
How can I give you all my love, baby
If you're always, always puttin' up your guard
This is not a circus
Don't you play me for a clown
How long can emotions keep on goin' up and down
I remember when it first began
We were tight right from the start
It wasn't long before you came on strong
I played hard to get but I couldn't help it
I gave up my ironing
You were thoughtful
Careful not to hurt the relationship
What happened to those days when you used to be compassionate
You cared what I thought and said
Such an attentive gentleman
Sometimes life tricks and teases you
There’s a mystery behind those eyes
Physicists and analysts study the world
Scientists discover the body
But I got there first, babe
The moon’s a figment of my imagination
There’s no way that I’ll ever go to Mars
Give me a spaceship and I’ll fly away
It’s hard to turn your head away from the TV set
You’ve been taking me for granted lately
Frankly, I gotta quit
Half the time I seem to give more than I get
Funny how things seem to change
I miss those nice massages
I long for closeness
The way you talk, how it turned me on
The thoughtfulness and the sweetest lips
Every day is so wonderful
Then suddenly it's hard to breathe.
Now and then I get insecure
From all the pain, I'm so ashamed.
To all your friends you're delirious
So consumed in all your doom
Trying hard to fill the emptiness.
The pieces gone, left the puzzle undone.
Is that the way it is?
I can't believe what you did to me
Down on my knees and I need to break free
All these years, you violated me
I don't know why I can't feel inside
Trying to hide, can't make it all right
It's overkill, now I'm ready to fight
Feeling confined, like I'm being forced in
My vision's blurry and I'm lost in regrets
It's overload, and I'm out of control
Taking me down with all your mental abuse
I must say, gotta get you out of my head
So sick and tired of feeling so misused
Leaving the house at quarter to five
Slipped on my boots and I'm ready to ride
And I feel so high, I feel so alive
Slowly drifting into a peaceful breeze
Tongue tied, twisted are all my memories
Celebrating a fantasy come true
Packing all my bags finally on the move
As I'm driving I'm captured by the view
So much beauty, the road becomes my muse
The heat is rising and my hands surf through the wind
Cool, calm, collected like the child that lies within
I turn up the radio
I'm feeling like I've never felt before
Turn down the memories of yesteryears and broken dreams
I'm free, finally free
Slowly drifting into a peaceful breeze
When they push, when they pull
Tell me can you hold on
When they say you should change
Can you lift your head high and stay strong
Will you give up, or will you give in
When your heart's crying out "that is wrong!”
You love yourself at the end of it all
I life there are gonna be times when you're feeling low
And in your mind insecurity seems to take control
We start to look outside ourselves
We look for acceptance and approval
We keep forgetting the one thing we should know
The boy who wonders is too good for them
Keep trying to please them all
But he never seems to fit in
The girl who thinks she'll never be good enough for him
She's trying to change and that's a game she'll never win
In life there will be times when you're feeling low
She comes in the mirror
He stares right at her when she comes
Face to face with her fears
Her own reflection is now a foreign body
After all these years
All of her life she has tried to be something besides herself
Now time has passed and she's washed up
Just another woman with regrets
Find your road and follow it through
Love will open every door
See in your hands, the world is yours
Don't look back, you'll find your way
Always know that the answers will unfold
Baby you pretend that things ain't what they seem
All this tension about exactly what we should be
Now I don't mind us being some kind of casual thing
Listen, I want you to come and take all of me
You see me with a man
If you see me with him, you know it’s over
There’s nothing as sweet as revenge
Life’s a bitter pill to swallow
The gentle breeze lifts up my skirt
Understand that you can't question me
These feelings ain't my fault
I can't help your jealousy
If you can handle that fact
We have got to be commitment free
Then we can keep this undercover
Lovin' comin', hidden' underneath the sheets
Underneath the sheets we have a physical thing
Our love is physical
We'll make love, but don't fall in love
Let me get mine, you get yours
No strings attached
My body has no strings attached
Don’t try and tug at my heart strings
I want your body, not your heart
Let me get mine, you get yours
It's explosive, speakers are pumping
Still jumping, six in the morning
Table dancing, glasses are crashing
No question, time for some action
Let's get open, cause a commotion
We're still going, eight in the morning
There's no stopping, we keep it popping
Hot rocking, everyone's talking
I keep my car looking like a crash dummy
My gear look like the bank got my money froze
I'm waiting for the performance to start
Frankly, it's a rap, no bargain deals
I drive a four wheel ride with foreign wheels
Baby it's brick city, have you heard of that
Dogs, let 'em out, women, let 'em in
Once upon a time there was a girl
In her early years she had to learn to live
How to grow up living in a war that she called home
Never knew where to turn for shelter from the storm
It hurt me to see the pain across my mother's face
My father's fist would put her in her place
Hearing all the yelling I would cry in my room
I hoped that it would be over soon
I often wonder why I carry all this guilt
You helped me put up all these walls I've built
Shadows stir at night through a crack in the door
The echo of a broken child screaming "please no more"
Daddy, don't you understand the damage you have done
To you it's just a memory, but for me it still lives on
It's not so easy to forget
All the lines you left along her neck
When I was thrown against cold stairs
And every day I'm afraid to come home
In fear of what I might see there
Oohhh, Yeah, Oooh Huh
I woke up this morning with a smile on my face
Nobody's gonna bring me down today
Nothing’s been going my way lately
So I decided right here and now that I gotta change
That's why I'm gonna say goodbye to all the tears I've cried
For everytime somebody hurt my pride
They won't let me live life
Take the time to look at what is mine
I see every lesson completely
I thank God for what I got from above
I believe they can take anything from me
But they can't succeed in taking my inner peace
They can say all they wanna say about me
I never wanna dwell on my pain again
There's no use in reliving how I hurt back then
Remembering all of the hell that I felt
Back then I was running out of faith
Every step I took was towards a better day
Cos I'm about to say goodbye to every single lie
And all the fears I've held too long inside
Everytime I felt I could try
All the negativity I had inside
Whoa, and everytime they forced me to dance
It never came naturally
So I ended up in misery, I wasn't able to see
There is so much good around me
They wasted so much energy on me
It’s hard, simply just remembering to breathe
Don't be fooled by the rocks that I got
Used to have a little, now I have a lot
I stayed grounded as the amounts roll in
I'm real, I thought I told you
It takes hard work to cash checks
So don't be fooled by the rocks that I got
I got dollar bills back in the bank
I make more money than you give thanks
You get back what you put in
You take the good route, I take the bad route
You just can't count on the hood
After a while, you know who to blend with
My hips movin' oh so slow
All I need is you here right by my side
Just put ya name on the dotted line
You set my soul at ease
Chase darkness out of view
Left your desperate spell on me
Say you feel it too, I know you do
I've got so much more to give
This can't die, I yearn to live
Pour yourself all over me
And I'll cherish every drop here on my knees
My mind fails to understand what my heart tells me to do
I'd give up all I have just to be with you
I've always been taught to win
And I never thought I'd fall
I’m at the mercy of a man
Now I only want to be right where you are.
In my life I've learned that heaven never waits
Lets take this now before it's gone
Cause when I'm with you there's nowhere else
Why would ever wanna be next to you
I'm breathing and I can feel you
Loving me, that’s ok
Every time you’re near baby
I get kinda crazy in my head for you
I don't know what to do
I get kinda shaky when they mention you
I just lose my cool
My friends tell me something has come over me
And I think I know what it is
Just the other night I saw you hanging
You were with your crew, I was with mine too
You took me by surprise
When you turn and look me in my eyes
Boy you really blow my mind
There are times I swear I know you're here
There are times I forget my fears
Feeling you my dear, watching over me
What will the future bring
I feel warm when you wrap me in your wings
And I can see your face
Your kiss I still can taste
Not a memory erased
Oh, I see your star shining down on me
And I'd do anything to just be free
So take me where you are
I was so young when I lost my virginity
Baby there are times when I act selfishly
I'm wishing that you are here with me
So I can wipe the tears away from your eyes
And make you see that every night while you are dreaming
I'm here to guard you from a far
Anytime I feel alone I close my eyes and dream
A place where you and I can breathe together
We'll be dancing in the moonlight
It's all about the way you're feeling
Deep in your heart
When she let you go
I don't doubt that you care
I believe that it tears you apart
Don't let your broken heart keep forever mending
And miss out on love that is never ending
I don't wanna take advantage
I know it's true that I can help undo the damage
All of the hurt that she did to you
You need someone you can talk to
Someone who feels the same about everything you do
And I could be the one to make you forget her
Boy I've been watchin’ you
And you've been watchin’ me
I know you want me baby
I'm gonna make you see that I'll give you what you need
I know the way ya feel, I’ll take ya higher baby
I want you here with me
Everything ya say, everything ya do
Makes me go crazy baby, I want you
You have turned me on and that's the way it is
Nothing could be better than this
So now I'm here for you and you are here for me
I'm gonna show you boy that we were meant to be
I've never been so sure, and now I want you more
Why don't you give it up, I'm gonna set you free now
Everything ya say, everything ya do
It makes me go crazy baby, I want you
You have turned me on and that's the way it is
Nothing could be better than this
Last night I saw you hanging out with another girl
Tell me what that's all about
You used to be my world
Six days and seven nights
Since we decided to say goodbye
But I'm still feeling you
I can't get you outta my mind
I tried so hard to fight it
But I can't let you go, no way to deny it
Don't even fool yourself
She'll never take my place
Put her up back on the shelf
She'll never win this race
Through all life’s ups and downs
I was always there for you
And now you think about somebody else
No one could do you better
I'll wait here forever
She'll never take my place
No one could do the things I do
I bring the lovin’ outta you
Deep in your heart you know it's true
You know that you should be with me
I got the lovin’ that ya need
It's just the way it's gotta be
You know I treated you right
I know the things that you like
And this much I know for sure
There was a time I was down and out
There was no lovin’ in my life
This angel came and brought a box
Took my dark and lonely days into the light
With his loving ways I gotta have him close to me
Each and every night
You gotta give me that security
Of dreamin’ and delight
Love has got a grip on me
It’s oh so tight, hope he never lets go
It feels so right, oh it feels so tight
He couldn't look me in the eye
He didn't make enough to take me out tonight
I beg him not to worry
I don't need a world of riches
I just need a little time with you
I don’t need Gucci and Prada
Designer brands can’t fill this emptiness
His lips are pure emotion
He smiles because he knows how good he makes me feel inside
He answers all my wishes
Who could ask for more?
He doesn't have to say I love you
When I see you there I'm so aware
Cause I don't deserve it, I don't come close
Can’t understand baby, the logic of your kind of trust
It amazes me that someone like you would care enough to believe
Even when I fall I get along
Cause our love is real baby
It's like salvation to my soul
Cause that's how it feels baby
It's a sacred thing that I keep close
And I know that I will be alright
And you'll heal it all
Sometimes I wake up in the dark of night
And in my mind there's a picture of you
I know someday this dream will come alive
So for now your shadow will do
I've never seen your face
But I know you’re in my heart
Maybe someday some place I'll hold you in my arms
I lay my head down on a pillow of white
You’re in the dark, I am cradled in peace
No thoughts from yesterday to haunt me at night
No tears to dry, no sad memories
And now I'll safely keep the strength that's in my soul
Come to me, come to me
Question: Tell me what you think about me
I buy my own diamonds and I buy my own rings
When it's all over please get up and leave
Question: Tell me how you feel about this
Try to control me, boy you get dismissed
Pay my own fun, oh and I pay my own bills
Always 50/50 in relationships
Tell me how you feel about this
I worked hard and sacrificed to get what I get
Ladies, it ain't easy being independent
How'd you like this knowledge that I brought
Bragging about that cash is just a front
If you're gonna brag make sure it's your money you flaunt
Depend on no-one else to give you what you want
I'm wishin' you the best
Pray that you are blessed
Bring much success, no stress, and lots of happiness
I'm not gon’ blast you on the radio
I'm not gon’ lie to you and your family
I'm not gon’ hate on you in the magazines
I'm not gon’ compromise my Christianity
You know I'm not gon’ diss you on the internet
My mama taught me better than that
You gotta do much better if you gone dance with me tonight
You gotta work your jelly if you gone dance with me tonight
Read my lips carefully if you like what you see
Move, groove, prove you can hang with me
By the looks, I got you shook and scared of me
Hook up your seatbelt, it's time for takeoff
I'm about to break you off
Lead my hips, slap my thighs
Swing my hair, square my eyes
Lookin’ hot, smellin’ good
Groovin’ like I'm from the hood
Look over my shoulder, I blow you a kiss
Can you handle, handle this
I shake my jelly at every chance
When I whip my hips you slip into a trance
I'm hoping you can handle all this jelly that I have
Now let's cut a rug while we scat some jazz
Shakin' that thang, lookin' all stank and nasty
You look cute girl in them dukes, booty all out lookin' trashy
You nasty girl, you nasty you trashy
You classless girl, you sleazy you freaky
Change don't come your way, it will come back to you
Heels on her feet, swear she's in heat
She’s flirtin' with every man she sees
Her pants hangin' low, she never says no,
Everyone knows she's easy, they’ve all had a go
Put some clothes on, you lookin' stanky
What's your problem, you should be ashamed
It’s hard for women who try to have some integrity
You make it hard for girls to respect themselves
You think you're cute, you think you're fine
You're always trying to steal my shine
Roll those eyes girl, twist your hips girl
Swing those hands in the air
You wonder why you never have a girlfriend
The answer’s clear as day
Girl change your ways right now today
He walks in the club with love in his eyes
As he steps, flockin’ females by his side
Lookin’ scrumptious, though he ain't trying
The finest thang that you ever did see
The sexy creation had his hat tilted to the side
Starin’ at me, had my nostrils open wide
Can't even vocalize what I visualize, and my body paralyzed
Would you enjoy sittin' next to me in your corduroys?
I'm from Texas, my girl is from Illinois
Where you from, can I come visit you sometimes?
My, oh my, you seem like husband material
Are you married cause you're extraordinary
It’s kinda scary how hot you are
I want your name in my vocabulary
Tell me your dreams and aspirations
Boy I'm lovin’ how you’re so unpredictable
My happiest moments were when you were by my side
You're my relation and connection to the sun
With you next to me, there's no darkness I can't overcome
You are my raindrops, I am the seed
With you and God, who's my sunlight, I'm blooming,
Like a flower I’ve grown so beautifully
Baby I'm so proud to be your girl
You make the confusion leave this cold and misty world
I appreciate your love and dedication
Later on I see myself having your child
It’s my destiny to be with you
It’s your destiny to feel me deep
I see myself being your wife
I see my whole future in your eyes
The thought sometimes makes me wanna cry
Let’s get this party started on a Saturday night
Everybody's waiting for me to arrive
Sendin' out the message to all of my friends
We'll be looking flashy in my Mercedes Benz
I got lot of style, check my gold diamond rings
I can go for miles if you know what I mean
I'm comin' up, so you better get this party started
Pumping up the volume, breaking down to the beat
Cruisin' through the west side
We'll be checkin' the scene
Boulevard is freakin' as I'm comin' up fast
I'll be burnin' rubber, you'll be kissin' my ass
Pull up to the bumper, get out of the car
Making my connection as I enter the room
Everybody's chilling as I set up the groove
Pumpin' up the volume with this brand new beat
Everybody's dancing and they're dancing for me
I'm your operator, you can call anytime
I'll be your connection to the party line
Never win first place, I don't support the team
I can't take direction, and my socks are never clean
Teachers dated me, my parents hated me
I was always in a fight cuz I can't do nothin' right
Everyday I fight a war against the mirror
I can't take the person starin' back at me
I can't stay on your life support,
There's a shortage in the switch,
I can't stay on your morphine,
'Cause it's making me itch
I said I tried to call the nurse again
But she's being a little bitch,
I haven't moved from the spot where you left me
This must be a bad trip
All of the other pills were different
Maybe I should get some help
I am the one y’all like to hate
I know that you're thinking about me
There's a song I was listenin' to all night
There's a voice I am hearin' sayin' its alright
When I'm happy, I'm sad, but everything is good
Its not that complicated, I'm just misunderstood
Things never go my way
Don’t you see that I'm superfly?
I see the world inside of you
I see the world in a crystal vase
I see the diamonds shining bright
My love lights up like a lampshade
You try to keep me in the shadows
On day I might say goodbye
Momma please stop cryin’, I can't stand the sound
Your pain is painful and its tearin' me down
I hear glasses breakin’ as I sit up in my bed
You fight about money, ‘bout me and my brother
And this I come home to, this is my shelter
It ain't easy growin’ up in World War Three
Never knowin’ what love could be
Daddy please stop yellin’, I can't stand the sound
Make mama stop cryin’, cuz I need you around
He sat in her boudoir while she freshened up
Boy drank all that magnolia wine
On her black satin sheets
They stained her white cotton sheets
That’s when he started to freak
We come through with the money
We love cake, straight out the gate
We independent women, not like those whores
I'm saying, why spend mine when I can spend yours
Wear high heeled shoes, get love from the dudes
Four badass chicks from the Moulin Rouge
All my girls are at the party
Look at that body, shakin' that thing
Got a nice package alright
Guess I'm gonna have to ride it tonight
I see you staring out the corner of my eye
You seem uneasy like you want to approach
But then something inside you grabs you
I know exactly cuz it happens with all the guys
Promise you won't even have an attitude
I'll let you sit right next to me
Don't join the list with all the other fools
I wanna see what you’re packing
I loved you endlessly,
But you weren't there for me.
So now it's time to leave so just hit me with the truth,
Now, girl, you're more than welcome to join
So give me one good reason to stop
Baby, come on, I live for you and me
And now I really come to see,
Life would be much better once you're gone
I'm giving up, I know for sure
I don't wanna be the reason for your love no more
I'm checkin' out, I'm signin' off
I don't wanna be the loser and I've had enough
Every little thing I do never seems enough for you
You don't wanna lose it again
Baby, it’s not fair you get to love somebody
Check the mirror, I’m lookin' fly
Round up the posse, jump in my ride
Radio rockin', hottest jam
Feel the rhythm, pump up the sound
Don't you know, I'm just groovin' to the beat
Yo some people say my solo is impossible
But when I get up on the mic, yo, I'm unstoppable
And it's probable when ya hear our voices laid down
You'll be boppin' your head to this ill sound
Now I know you thought you had me played
On the floor, rockin' to the beat
Either way, it sure looks sweet
Fine young lady, standin' in my shadow
Come on baby, show me that sweet eye delight
I love the way that you move
You look so sweet when you're movin' to the beat
I'm tired of all these boring parties
Why don't we get on down
I’ll get down and you get on top
The visions around you bring tears to your eyes
And all that surrounds you are secrets and lies
I'll be your strength,
I'll give you hope,
Keeping your faith when it's gone
My number is the one you should call,
I've loved you forever,
In lifetimes before
And I promise you will not hurt anymore
I give you my word
I give you my heart
This is a battle we've won
The armies line up on the battlefield
I see you checkin’ me out
And with this vow forever has now begun
I see the things he does to you
All the pain that he puts you through
And I see what's really going on
Staying out at night while you're by the phone
He doesn't give you the kind of attention
His eyes wander 'round
He doesn't see you like I see
That's when I'll stop loving you
I'm sure you've heard these words before
And I know it's hard for you to trust them again
You're afraid it all might end
And a broken heart is scared of breaking again
But you've gotta believe me, I’ll never leave you
You'll never cry as long as I am there
And I will always be there
You will never be without love
As long as sunlight lights the sky
Light of love will be found in these eyes of mine
And when this world doesn't turn anymore
When the stars all decide to stop shining
Til then I'm gonna to be by your side
Gonna be loving you every day of my life
I know your heart anticipates
I know my love is on your mind
Well don't you worry I won't keep you waiting
Cause I ain't ever seen a lady so fine
I know what you want me to do
It's in your eyes
I’ve got something for you
They're telling me you'll open your heart to me
Cause if you want, I’ll sacrifice my world for you
I’ll show you the way love’s supposed to be yeah
Now I know you think I must be faking
I promised all these things right from the start
So don't you rush into decision making
Cause I just wrote this song to tell you my heart
Girl there's nothing I won't do
To make you see that this is where you should be
Cause baby we can do anything you wanna do
Girl I wanna be a part of your fantasy
She was my once in a lifetime
She was my happy ending come true
Oh I guess I should have told her
But I thought she knew
She said I took her for granted
That’s the last thing I would do
Oh I'll never understand it
'Cause I thought she knew
A heart full of words left unspoken
I feel empty now that we're through
I'd sell my soul to have this silence broken
Oh I guess I should have told her
Monday night and I feel so low
I count the hours but they go so slow
I know the sound of your voice can save my soul
City lights, streets of gold
Look out my window to the world below
Moves so fast but it feels so cold
From the moment I first saw you
I knew my heart could not be free
I had to hold you in my arms
There can never be another for me
All I need is the rhythm divine
Can you feel the heat of passion?
Can you taste our love's sweet wine?
Join the dance and let it happen
Put tomorrow's cares right out of your mind
As the music draws you closer and you fall under my spell
I will catch you in my arms
Gotta have this feeling forever
Gotta live this moment together
Nothing else matters
Just you and the night
Follow on the wings of desire
Now the rhythm is taking you higher
No one can stop us from havin' it all
You are my heart, you are my soul
Where the night can take us no one can tell
I was too young, and you were much younger
We were afraid of each other's hunger
Since we kissed the first time
Since we slept together on the beach
I felt the sand on my body
I felt the saltwater seep inside me
So warm, so cool, like nothing else
You were too close for comfort
You were too far out of reach
You walked away, I should have held you
I should have made my move sooner
Now this is how it's got to be
I won't have you cheatin' on me
First of all, I’m not trustworthy
Tell me who to trust if I can't trust you
I refuse to let you play me for a fool
You said that we could possibly spend eternity
Somehow you knew that your love would be untrue
I realised that I want you in my life
The things that we've been saying on the telephone
If they ever knew that we were secretly into each other
When I opened up my eyes today I felt the sun shining on my face
It became so clear to me that everything is going my way
I feel like there's no limit to what I can see
Got rid of fears that were holding me
Endless possibilities
Now the day is turning into night
And everything is still going right
There's no way you can stop me this time
Or break this spirit of mine
Like the stars above I'm gonna shine
Anything I want will be mine
Tonight I'm gonna have a good time
If you only knew what I've been going through
I’ve been waiting and wanting you
Could this be love?
Will my heart make me believe it so?
Or can I trust the way I feel?
If you could read my mind you would see how hard I've tried
Like a movie scene, in the sweetest dreams
We’re like Romeo and Juliet
I want to feel your lips on my fingertips
It is even better than I ever thought it could possibly be
It's perfect, it's passion, it's setting me free
I know I can make you mine
Touch me in that place I like
You know how to make me wet
Take a moment to stop and think about it all
Come on baby, nobody's gonna see
'Cause I know you're feeling me
I can see it in your eyes
Ain't no use in tryin' to hide
When I touch you get hot
Then I got you where I want you
I know it's on your heart
A love like ours shall never fall apart
You're so afraid of the rain
So I will take your hand
And I'll love you in the best way that I can
And I only expect the same
Though I'm sure of what I feel
Never thought a love so true felt so unreal
And I'm a little afraid myself
If you love me day by day
With an honest heart and a little faith
Baby time will tell the tale
I know you were just trying to play me
Who did you think that you were involved with?
You should know that it ain't that serious
It should concern you that I'm always one step ahead of you
So don’t run those games on me
I can’t be fooled by you
I can see the lies coming through your teeth
Every word you speak makes it clear to me
I see that your game ain't strong
I've been in this too long, so just be moving on
When you rolled up in the Escalade
I saw the keys that you gave to the valet
It was game over when you looked at me
Pulling up your sleeve so I could see the Roley bling
I saw you later in the corner booth
You were raising up a toast so I would notice you
When I took a chance, I thought you'd understand
Baby, credit cards aren't romance
So you're tryna buy what's already yours
What I need from is not available in stores
Seen a side of you that I really like
Doing way too much, never keep it real
If it doesn't change, gotta hit the road
Now I'm leaving, where's my keys?
Don't be fooled by the rocks that I got
Used to have a little, now I have a lot
It takes hard work to cash checks
An Angel is one of God's most precious works
She was an Angel in disguise
But now you see your mistakes
And now you see your angel was a fake
But my love was never misplaced
Heartbreaker you've got the best of me
But I just keep on comin' back incessantly
Oh why did you have to run your game on me
I should have known right from the start, you'd go and break my heart
It's a shame to be so euphoric and weak
You deal with things, but you don't have to
He doesn't love ya, I can tell by his charm
Running fast in my mind
Girl don't you slow it down
If we carry on, this thing might leave the ground
That's how my queen should ride
But you still deserve the crown
When I look into your eyes I see something that money can't buy
Ain't nobody love you like I love you
People are so phoney
Nosy cause they're lonely
Aren't you sick of the same thing?
They say so and so were dating
They love you or they're hating
Well it doesn't matter anyway, cause we're here tonight
If you’re smiling, that should set the tone
And if you let go, the music will groove your bones
Ain't nobody love you like I love you
You're a good girl and that's what makes me trust you
I talk to you late at night
You will know the difference when I touch you
I look and stare so deep in your eyes,
I touch you more every time,
When you left I begged you not to go,
Why do you have to leave me all alone
People lining up in a row,
At the club the music is thumping
Love’s such a funny thing for me to try to explain,
My pride is the one to blame.
'Cuz I know I don't understand,
Your love can do what no one else can.
Tennis shoes, don't even need to buy a new dress,
If you ain't there, there ain't nobody to impress,
It's the beat that my heart skips when I'm with you,
I've been playing myself, baby I don't care
'Cuz your love's got the best of me,
And baby you're making a fool of me,
You got me sprung and I don't care who sees,
I'm feelin' sexy
I wanna hear you say my name boy
If you can reach me
You can feel my burning flame
I'm feelin kind of nasty
I just might take you home with me
Baby the minute I feel your energy
Your vibe's just taken over me
Start feelin’ so crazy babe
I feel the funk coming over me
We dance to the beat ’til the sun comes up
I don't know what's gotten into me
The rhythm's got me feelin’ so crazy babe
I'm so wrapped up in your love
Let me go, let me breathe
Please, stay out of my fantasies
In our own little world, the music is the sun
The dance floor becomes the sea
Feels like true paradise to me
Picture us dancin’ real close
In a dark corner of a basement party
Every time I close my eyes it's like everyone left but you and me
Are you infatuated with me
I could end your curiosity
If you don't think I'm too rude
Here's your chance to make your move
I sit and wait for nobody
People say that my style is too crazy
I think you like it baby, do you want to get nasty?
I dare you to undress me
You whisper softly in my ear
Makes me unwind, makes me lose my mind
The way you touch me lets me know you're mine
There is nothing I won't do for you
I know my soul is connected to you
I feel so safe when I’m alone with you
I'm holding back nothing
Baby, I’m saving it all for you
Baby I love making love to you
It's like a high I can't come down from
I believed everything we had would last
So young and naive for me to think that she was from your past
Silly of me to dream of having your kids
Love is so blind
It feels right when it's wrong
I can't believe I fell for your schemes
I'm know I’m smarter than that
I know that with me you're a changed man
Foolish to compete when you cheat with loose women
It took me some time but now I moved on
Now that it's over stop calling me
Come pick up your clothes
Don’t need to act like you're still with me
Even your very best friend tried to warn me on the low
It took me some time, but now I am strong
You were on the wall, I was with my crew
You were watching me baby
I was watching you
Slowly you walked over
I maintained my cool
You said hello to me, I said hello to you
You asked me where I'm from, I asked you what you do
You some how intrigued me
I thought you were so cool
Somewhere between hi and goodbye
I felt so comfortable
I felt like we could talk all night
So I gave you my number
You were at my house, sitting on the couch
You were really buggin’ out
So I told you to get out
I misjudged you, I thought you were cool
You had a lotta nerve
Too damn old to be so immature
You said I move too slow, so I showed you to the door
You said you’d call me later
I said don't call no more
Its cool if you can't wait for me
I'm glad you showed me your true face baby
It was the first time I said no
In December every sign has a tale
I was in love with a Sagittarius
See the emotions he put me through
From Capricorns to Aquarius
They’ve all got different minds
The affection of a Virgo, matches well with me
I was in love with a man who blew my mind
He flipped out like a Gemini
He was freaky like a Taurus the way he handled me
Flirtatious like an Aries
Where you been baby, I waited for you all day
Waited for you to use the key
My heart starts trembling
And I hear your footsteps pace
The lock opens, the doorknob turns
You were standing in front of me
I need a thug that’ll have my back
Do-rag, Nike Airs to match
Ain’t nothin’ wrong with that
That’s how I like it, baby
Where are my thugs at?
White T-Shirt, I love that
Come a little closer so that we can see into the eyes of love
Just a little closer, let me speak to you
I want to softly tell you something
Come a little closer, let me whisper in your ear
Cuz I wanna tell you something
Move on in real close so we can celebrate
I love the way we feel about each other's love
That’s how I like it, baby
I believe that harmonies are colors
Every time I paint it sharpens my harmony
Yesterday I tried to paint you
Reaching for something in the distance
So close you can almost taste it
Release your inhibitions
Feel the rain on your skin
No one else can feel it for you
Only you can let it in
No one else can speak the words on your lips
Drench yourself in words unspoken
Live your life with arms wide open
Today is where your book begins
The rest is still unwritten
I break tradition, sometimes my tries are outside the lines
We've been conditioned to not make mistakes,
I can't live that way
If I may be so bold I’ll make a suggestion
Please ask yourself why are you doing this
Staring at the blank page before you
Open up the dirty window
Let the sun illuminate the words that you can’t find
You think that we connect
That the chemistry's correct
Your words walk right through my ears
Presuming I like what I hear
And now I'm stuck in the the web you're spinning
You've got me for you prey
I'm like a beggar with no luck
I'm holding signs up on street corner stops
Like most you try not to see me
You stare straight ahead
You ignore the responsibility
For most love comes for free
They don't pay the high cost of mental custody
I'll pay bail for a guarantee
Please make space for me
Take this pink ribbon off my eyes
I'm exposed and it's no big surprise
Don't you think I know exactly where I stand
This world is forcing me to hold your hand
The moment that I step outside
So many reasons for me to run and hide
I can't do the little things I hold so dear
'Cause it's those little things that I fear
'Cause I'm just a poor little girl
'Cause they won't let me drive late at night
Oh I'm just a girl, guess I'm some kind of freak
'Cause they all sit and stare with their eyes
I'm just a girl, living in captivity
Your rule of thumb makes me worrisome
The uncertainty you had, it brought cloudy shady company
The tenderness habitual
A seldom-fading ritual
You killed a pair of doves
Now only one is breathing
Oh when you walk by every night
Talking sweet and looking fine
I get kind of hectic inside
Oh baby I'm so into you
Darling if you only knew all the things that flow through my mind
Images of rapture
Creep into me slowly
As you're going to my head
And my heart beats faster
It’s time to take me over
Time and time and time again
One summer night we ran away for a while
To an obscure place that no one could find
And we drifted to another state of mind
I imagined I was yours and you were mine
As we lay upon the grass there in the dark
Beautiful and bittersweetly
You were fading into me
And I was gently fading into you
But the time went sailing by
Reluctantly we said good-bye
And left our secret place so far behind
And I lay in bed all night
Take a look inside my heart
Tell me what you think you see
I may not be the innocent girl
I’m not who you wanted me to be
Some nights I just wanna lover
Some nights I don't need a friend
Some nights I just need somebody to hold me 'till the end
You kiss me in the rain again and again
Your touch is driving me insane
I'm riding on top of your waves,
I'm head over heels now
Knowing you and me will surely find a way
No compromising and all I see are brighter skies
Two years on and still I'm head over heels
Ups and downs, still you come my way
I'm lying by your side, another winter is here
I got summer on my mind
Checking your reflection is what really turns you on
And you're loving every minute thinking everyone has gone
You just roll your eyes and you fantasize
Out at every party so the pain don't show
Talking too much, laughing too loud so that everybody knows
I can't deny these thoughts inside
You are always on my mind
And it scares me so, that I’m losing control
And I know I'm gonna let it happen
The only one who touched my heart
But I was just another lover
You could have satisfied the me entirely
You had the power to uncover
You touched me deeper than the eye could see
I never want another lover
A shining light amongst the stormy sea
You gave me more than any other
And I'm beginning to relive again
All the magic that you gave me
So don't you expect me to forget
When love is all around me
Never thought of me as sentimental
Never thought of you as just a friend
But now that we are something more than distant
I got a need for you that never ends
No matter how hard I try I just can't deny it
Holding on to feelings so strong is a danger
When will the time be right to just give it a try
I want to tell you all my secrets
But I keep them locked inside
Here alone I'm just waiting for a sign
So it's just another night and I'm here without you
That night we huddled up on the train
The midnight express heading straight for the city
Just wanna escape my hectic life
I know that life can be so much more simple
I feel the gulf that grows between us
I feel the love that parts the seas
I’m so proud to be from the USA
The war is on and we’re together
Our love’s as old as the birds and the bees
He packed his suitcase and stormed out of the house
He left his dignity behind
He can’t resist big boobs and asses
Journey to the end of the world
Partying, gambling, living so free
Guys just wanna get close to me
Girls wanna get close to XXXXX
Remember how you got bullied in high school
You think of me as a tool
I’m gonna steal your wallet and your phone
Love’s all a deception
I need more than a bodyguard to give me protection
It made me melt, and then I froze
Blood boils, I get so angry
You’re not the one I’m going to marry
Marry me and be with me forever
You and me, we’re the dream team
I’m done with flirting with girls
I think it’s time to settle down
You’re the one I wanna spend my life with
Politics is bad, but the government’s misunderstood
A thousand soldiers outside our palace
We’re fighting for our lives
I can hear their footsteps on the stairs
I can feel my heart beating
In the fields sheep are bleating
Life goes on regardless, it’s all so fake
